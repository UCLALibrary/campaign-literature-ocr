EXPANDING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY: “Today’s
Democratic Party will stand firmly against the Republican assault on
education. Cutting education as we move into the 21st century would be
like cutting defense spending at the height of the Cold War. We must do
more to expand educational opportunity — not less.”

HELPING STUDENTS WITH GOALS 2000 AND SCHOOL-TO-
WORK: We passed Goals 2000 to help schools set high standards, and
find the resources they need to succeed: the best books, the brightest
teachers, the most up-to-date technology ... We passed School-to-Work so

| young people can leam the skills they need to get and keep high wage jobs.

The Republican Congress is trying to destroy it, and we pledge to stop
them. We want to keep working with the private sector, to encourage
community partnerships that build the bridge between a good education
and a good job.
