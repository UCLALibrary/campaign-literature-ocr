WE NEED YOUR HELP TO PASS
PROP. A IN YOUR COMMUNITY

Campaign Manual & Information Available: We have compiled a comprehensive Campaign Manual
which outlines the most important things you can do in your own community to help the effort to pass Proposition
A. Please let us know if you need any information on the LA County Safe Neighborhood Parks Act, including local
summaries for your area, fact sheets, funding breakdowns and current endorsements.

Thank you for your willingness to be part of the countywide network of people working to pass the LA County Safe
Neighborhood Parks Act. This measure can win in November - with your help in mounting a strong and targeted
campaign. We can’t do this without you! Please call Campaign Headquarters today and find out what else you
can do to help.

We appreciate all of your time and effort so far, and look forward to working closely with you in the next two
months. Please feel free to call us at (310) 474-9823 if you have any questions or if we can provide you with any
additional information.
