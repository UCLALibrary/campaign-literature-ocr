“And it’s because of
SMRR that we didn’t
have to move away.
That’s why we
always vote SMRR.”

Today, more than ever, we need a SMRR majority
on the City Council.

Since SMRR passed our landmark rent control law in 1979, SMRR Council members
have tirelessly defended renters rights in the courts and in the state legislature.

Today, SMRR is faced with a new challenge. Since the powerful real estate lobby got
the Costa Bill passed in Sacramento last year, Santa Monica will be forced to phase in
“vacancy decontrol.” “Vacancy decontrol” provides financial incentive for landlords to
“get” tenants to move. How? Well, in other communities, vacancy decontrol has resulted
in unfair harassment and evictions — sometimes forcing people out of their homes.

We can stop this from happening in Santa Monica by electing the SMRR backed
candidates to the City Council — and by stopping the landlord-backed slate from
winning even one more seat.
