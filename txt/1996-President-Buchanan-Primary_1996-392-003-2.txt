* In six of our greatest cities -- Chicago, Denver,
Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New York -- 20 percent of all

arrests are of illegal aliens.

* In Los Angeles, 40 percent of the illegal immigrants
released from jail are later re-arrested for new crimes.

* And as just one example of “high profile” crime, two
illegal immigrants from Pakistan masterminded the deadly bombing
of the World Trade Center in New York last year.

But this truly is a crisis we’re facing. And although
certain parts of the country -- California, Texas, Florida,
New York -- are on the “front lines,” the ramifications of this
crisis affect our entire nation.

That’s why I favor strong action to stem the tide of illegal
immigration:

(1) Denying all federal social benefits to illegal aliens.

(2) Building permanent, unclimbable fences at targeted
urban border crossings, such as San Diego and El Paso,
where 90 percent of illegal aliens enter our country.

(3) Full funding 6,000 new Border Patrol agents, and
providing them with the vehicles and technology they
need to carry out their mission effectively.

(4) Deporting illegal aliens to the interior of their
country of origin, instead of just dropping them off on
the other side of the border.

The other major Presidential candidates do not believe tough
action is needed against illegal immigration.

Phil Gramm actually opposes California’s Proposition 187
which cuts off benefits for illegal aliens.

And Senator Bob Dole and Senator Arlen Specter both voted
AGAINST legislation in Congress that would allow states like
California to cut off benefits for illegal aliens.

At a time when American taxpayers are forced to pay almost $1
BILLION each year just to convict and imprison criminal aliens,
President Clinton and the other Republican candidates have
decided that Reseunocdibion nity reform isn’t urgent. Th r ana
