VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION 218
THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON TAXES ACT

Property tax bills are showing huge increases in
assessment district fees. Prop. 218 would put a
stop to these end runs around Proposition 13, and

WILL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON
TAX INCREASES!

Proposition 218 guarantees your right to vote
on local tax increases — even when they are called
something else, like “assessments” or “fees” and
imposed on homeowners.

Proposition 218 guarantees your right to vote
on taxes imposed on your water, gas, electric, and
telephone bills.

Proposition 218 does NOT prevent government
from raising and spending money for vital services
like police, fire and education. If politicians want to
raise taxes they have to convince local voters that
new taxes are really needed.

Proposition 218 simply extends the |

long standing constitutional protection

against politicians imposing tax increases without

voter approval.

After voters passed Proposition 13, politicians
created a loophole in the law that allows them to
raise taxes without voter approval by calling taxes
“assessments” and “fees.”

Once this loophole was created, one lawyer
working for the politicians, said, “assessments ...
are now limited only by the limits of human imag-
ination.”

How imaginative can the politicians be
with assessments? Here are a few examples among
thousands:
¢ A view tax in Ventura County — the better the

view of the ocean you have the more you pay.

¢ In Los Angeles, a proposal for assessments for a
$2-million scoreboard and a $6-million equestri-
an center to be paid for by property owners.

‘ ¢ In Northern California, a taxpayer 27-miles away
from a park is assessed because his property sup-
posedly benefits from that park.

¢ In Kern County, homeowners are assessed to
refurbish a college football field.

Recommendations

The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association (HJTA)
is dedicated to the protection of Proposition 13 and
the advancement of taxpayers’ rights. The associa-
tion takes positions on issues of direct concern to
taxpayers. We also take positions on ballot mea-
sures that will impact the economy. This is
because, as taxpayers know from painful experi-
ence, when the economy turns sour and tax rev-
enues go down, governments’ usual reaction is to
reach for the taxpayer’s wallet.

We strongly urge a vote of YES on
Proposition 218, the Right to Vote on Taxes Act,
see pages 1, 3, 4 and 5.

We recommend a NO vote on Propositions
207, 211, 214 and 216. For more information on
these “job killers”, please see pages 2 and 3. We
also recommend a NO vote on Prop. 217, an
income tax increase.

We recommend a YES vote on Proposition
208, campaign reform. For more information on
Prop. 208 please see page 5.

Proposition 212 is a defective effort at cam-
paign reform that allows unlimited gifts to politi-
cians. We urge a NO vote. O
