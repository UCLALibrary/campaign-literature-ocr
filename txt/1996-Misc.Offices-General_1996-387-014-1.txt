CHAPMAN

for BOARD of EDUCATION

September 14, 19

Dear Friends:

I am writing to you to officially announce my candidacy for elective office. My
nine years of volunteer work within a school environment have been valuable
training. Now I would like to strengthen my commitment to our public
schools by serving as your elected representative to the Santa Monica/Malibu
Unified School District Board of Education.

My goal is to ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed. I intend
to be responsive to all constituencies through communication, mutual
respect, and teamwork. I will work for common goals, guided by a
commitment to quality, equity and respect for diverse points of view. As
Marian Wright Edelman says, "If we don't stand for children, we don't stand
for much." I believe our American democracy will succeed or fail depending
on how well we work together to educate ALL children.

I need your help. Four people are running for three seats on the Board. There
are considerable costs associated with campaigning. I must get my message out
through mass mailings to targeted voters. Please fill out the enclosed card to
indicate how you are able to assist me. I appreciate whatever support you can
ive. The most important contribution you can make is to endorse me to your
Prien and to vote for me in November.

Sincerely

Dorothy Chapman
