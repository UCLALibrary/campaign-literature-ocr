"A YES vote for Proposition
K will help our youth avoid a
life of crime by providing
them with after school
activities, parks, gymnasiums,
boys and girls clubs, and
other recreational facilities.
We know that each young
person who participates in
positive activities in a safe
park is one less child we have
to worry about turning to
gangs and crime. A YES vote
on Proposition K will provide
over 40 park improvements
and facilities in the San
Fernando Valley.”

Councilmember
Laura Chick

Chair,
Public Safety Committee

“Police on the beat support Proposition K. They know that a vote for Proposition K is a vote for
safer neighborhoods and safer streets, and investing in our youth is part of public safety. Vote
YES on safer neighborhoods. Vote YES on Proposition K.”

William B. Harkness

President, Los Angeles Police Protective League

“Proposition K provides needed monies to improve parks and recreation in our neighborhoods.

Every neighborhood in Los Angeles will benefit from Proposition K, as nearby parks and

recreation centers will become safer places for kids to play, learn, and grow into better citizens.”
Annette Hall

President, League of Women Voters

“Proposition K is a fiscally responsible answer to our need to provide valuable recreational
resources for our citizens. People who care about the future of Los Angeles should vote YES on
Proposition K.”

Councilman Marvin Braude

Chair, Environmental Quality Committee
