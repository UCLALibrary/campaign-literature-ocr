Adam Schiff served as a Federal Criminal eo
Prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for six —
years — and he never lost a trial.

| ADAM SCHIFF. Leadership, not ak Sala

While the Sacramento politicians bicker over who gets a bigger office and who will be Speaker, our
state’s serious problems get worse. Criminals evade arrest and conviction in a system which
penalizes victims. California’s classrooms are now the most crowded in the nation. A lack of business
judgement and economic foresight in our state capitol jeopardizes our economic recovery. And the
beauty of many of our neighborhoods is threatened.

Our state needs tough, smart and independent leaders to make tough, smart and independent
decisions about our future. Our state needs Adam Schiff in the State Senate.

Adam Schiff - an experienced prosecutor, local newspaper columnist, and community leader - will
take his unique public safety and problem-solving experience to Sacramento and get past the
politicians’ partisan squabbling.
