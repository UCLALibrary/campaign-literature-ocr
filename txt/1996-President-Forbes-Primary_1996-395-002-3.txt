Steve Forbes
‘A Breath of Fresh Air’

“Forbes has boldness,
independence, high intellect,

brilliant ideas.”
—R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.,
Editor in Chief, The American Spectator

“Forbes’ entry into the presi-
dential field is a welcome
event. He has a coherent set of
conservative ideas, focused on
replacing the income tax with

a flat tax.”
— David Broder,
The Washington Post

“Steve Forbes’ decision to
become a candidate for the
Republican presidential nomi-
nation comes as a breath of
fresh air to a party desperately
in need of a champion for

economic growth.”
—Donald Lambro,
Chief Political Correspondent,
The Washington Times
