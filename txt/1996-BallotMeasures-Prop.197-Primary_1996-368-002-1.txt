A History of California’s Mountain Lion Policies

The status of California’s mountain lion population, Felis concolor, has changed
several times during this century, ranging from a bountied predator, where trackers
were paid for each mountain lion they killed, to a specially protected species, where
limitations on taking mountain lions became strict and severe. At no time in its
history has the mountain ever been considered a “threatened or endangered” species.

From 1907, when the animal’s status was first designated by the state, to
1963, the mountain lion was listed as a bountied predator, primarily as a result of
conflicts with livestock production. From 1963 to 1969, the mountain lion was listed
as a non-game mammal, which was followed by a two-year period of designating the
animal as a game mammal.

In 1972, political pressure resulted in a several-year moratorium on mountain
lion hunting by the Legislature. This moratorium lasted three to four years and was
periodically reinstated as authorizing legislation sunsetted.

In 1986, the moratorium sunsetted without being reinstated by the Legislature,
making the mountain lion a game animal once again. In 1987, the Department of
Fish and Game proposed a limited hunting program that would have issued roughly
150 tags in three zones, but this proposal was stopped by legal action brought forth
by animal rights and anti-hunting organizations that used the proposal’s compliance
with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as the basis for its suit. In
1988, the Department proposed a revised version of their 1987 program for limited
hunting, only to have this proposal stopped by litigation alleging further CEQA
conflicts that lingered until 1989. In 1989, the Department also released a study of
the mountain lion population, which excluded sub-adult lions (under 2 years old),
showing 5,100 mountain lions living in California.

Failure to reinstate the hunting moratorium prompted animal rights activists
and environmentalists to push for a long-term ban on hunting as well as more
extensive protections for the mountain lion. :

In 1990, voters narrowly approved Prop. 117 on a 52 to 48 percent vote (it
received 237,570 more “yes” votes than “no” votes and was defeated in 41 of 58
counties). The Proposition made it illegal to kill a mountain lion, except in the
process of self-defense or when wildlife officials issue a depredation permit to kill a
lion that has proved to be an “imminent threat” to public safety. By doing this, the
Proposition went beyond making hunting illegal, it actually barred the Deparmtment
from managing the polulation and provided mountain lions with more protection than
even an endangered species by preventing all wildlife management tools.
