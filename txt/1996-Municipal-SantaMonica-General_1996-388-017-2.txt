A Little Recent Santa Monica History:

1992: Asha Greenberg, a County prosecutor, fed up with the City Council's failure
to deal with aggressive panhandling and camping in our parks, is elected ona
strong public safety platform.

1994: After being opposed by a City Council dominated by Santa Monicans for Renters
Rights, Asha leads Citizens for a Safe Santa Monica in collecting over 10,000
signatures for an initiative measure.

Now, in 1996, Citizens for a Safe Santa Monica asks you to support Asha Greenberg,
as she has supported you over the last four years, and to elect her running mates
Frank Schwengel and Shari Davis.

Please also keep our 911 System working when we need it! Vote “‘YES’’ on Proposition EE
which is endorsed by the Santa Monica Police Officers Association, the Santa Monica
Firefighters Association and the Santa Monica Commission on Older Americans.

Help make Santa Monica a safer place to live, work and play
