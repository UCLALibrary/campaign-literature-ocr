TAXING TIMES

Proposition 211 is a Costly

Disaster for Taxpayers

Proposition 211 would allow unscrupulous lawyers to file frivolous lawsuits in
California that are outlawed under federal law. It would give them tremendous
leverage to force innocent companies to settle rather than fight meritless secu-

rities lawsuits.

Economists estimate that all these new frivolous lawsuits will cost
California nearly $100 million over the next ten years in higher court costs.
And, because of companies and jobs fleeing California, the state could face
revenue losses of $5.1 billion during the same period. This means huge tax
increases or reductions in funding to education, law enforcement and other

vital programs.

Important points for taxpayers to consider
in evaluating Proposition 211:

Y The initiative would shift the
securities class-action cases now
brought in federal court into the
California state courts. To process the
landslide of frivolous lawsuits,
California taxpayers would have to
pay nearly $100 million over the
next decade in new court costs for
judges, clerks and courtrooms,
according to a study by the Law and
Economics Consulting Group, Inc.,
of Emeryville.

oY By discouraging investment,
the initiative would erode the
employment and tax base of Cali-
fornia. The study found that over the
next decade the measure would
reduce state tax revenues by

as much as $5.1 billion,
requiring massive tax
increases or reductions
for crucial programs
like law enforcement
and education.

Y The initiative would
cost the state nearly ®
159,000 jobs and cause a
decline in economic activity that
would reduce the average Califor-
nia household income by $155
to $235 each year.

VY Securities class-actions are huge
lawsuits. According to a recent survey
by the Federal Judicial Center, securi-
ties class-actions in federal courts
consume almost FIVE times the
judicial resources of the average
civil case.

Y The initiative would grant
immunity for government officials
and governmental entities, like
Robert Citron and Orange County,
for losses they cause that are coy-
ered under this measure. This
“loophole for politicians” will dra-
matically increase the cost ae

rowing funds for municipal govern-
ments, which means increased costs
for taxpayers:

All these frivolous lawsuits
would clog our courts, leaving peo-
ple with legitimate lawsuits to face
years of delays in trying to recover
damages.

¥ Because the initiative would cre-
ate new and undefined legal stan-
dards, the California state courts
would have to devote even more
resources to resolve difficult and
intractable legal problems.

Because of the threat of abusive
and frivolous litigation, high-tech and
bio-tech companies would

such as Arizona and
Utah, where frivolous
lawsuits are discour-
aged — not encouraged.

Y The businesses that
choose to remain in Califor-
nia would face increased costs
and reduced economic output.
According to the study, the initiative
would add $1.5 billion a year in the
next decade to operating costs of Cali-
fornia businesses and increase by 82
percent, from $137 million to $249 mil-
lion, the cost of settlements and legal
fees directly related to securities class-
action suits. Over that same period, the
measure would increase to $1.3 billion
annually the amount California busi-
nesses pay for “protective” measures
designed to reduce the risk of lawsuits.

"A We all agree that those who are
truly injured by securities fraud
need to be able to file suit to recover
their losses, but Proposition 211 is
only about filing frivolous securi-
ties lawsuits. 1)

Approval of new taxes should
be up to the people, not the politi-
cians. That's why over one million
Californians signed petitions to put
Proposition 218 on the November
ballot. Voting YES on Proposition
218 will give the people the right
to vote on new taxes and protect
Proposition 13.

Taxes these days come under
different names, such as assessments
or fees. Proposition 218 will give
the voters the right to vote on all of
them. The assessments and fees are
usually put exclusively on property
owners. Proposition 218 makes sure
the property owners who must pay
these levies give their consent.

Recently, taxpayers got into an
uproar in Los Angeles County
when the local Community
College District proposed an
assessment on property to fund
landscaping and lighting at the col-
leges. The proposal included
building an equestrian center and
funding an electronic scoreboard
for an athletic field. Assessments

property, but neither the equestrian
center nor the scoreboard would
benefit the property of those tax-
payers required to pay the bill.
Proposition 218 is the only
answer the taxpayers have to defeat
outlandish taxing schemes. Under

Proposition 218, the people, not the

bureaucrats, will have the final deci-

sion on local tax increases. If the

government agencies build a good

case for a tax increase, it will pass.
If approved by the voters,

Proposition 218 will:

* Strengthen existing law to
require all new local taxes —
like utility user taxes — be sub-
mitted to voters for approval.

* Require a majority vote of prop-
erty owners to approve all new

Protect Proposition 13,
Vote YES on Proposition 218

on property are supposed to benefit

assessments on property.

¢ Require existing assessments,
that do not directly benefit prop-
erty, be ratified by a majority of
property owners.

* Strictly limit the use of fees and
charges imposed on property owners.

* Provide local voters the right to
use the initiative to make changes
in local laws governing taxes,
fees, assessments and charges.

Proposition 218 may be the
last, best hope to stop runaway tax-
ation. When a California Supreme
Court decision four years ago
expanded the ability to use assess-
ment districts to tax property, a
lawyer working for municipalities
said assessment districts are now
limited only by the limits of human
imagination. Taxpayers beware.

Assessments and fees have
exploded in the last number of
years, increasing billions of dollars
statewide. Check your property tax
bill to see a list of extra assess-
ments and charges you now pay.

The bureaucracy has used its
imagination in creating some
unusual taxes. There was the
famous view tax in Ventura
County, in which properties with a
better view of the ocean paid more
to finance an ocean park. Or the
assessment in Northern California,
in which a property 27 miles away
from a park paid the same tax as
the property across from the park
under the principle that both prop-
erties benefited equally from the
park. Other outrageous examples
of abuse of the assessment law
exist around the state.

If these ridiculous taxation
schemes are to be stopped, tax
matters must be put in the hands of
the voters. If you think the people
should have the right to vote on
taxes, then Vote YES on
Proposition 218 on November 5.
And please ask your friends and
neighbors to do the same!

Why Proposition 207 is a Job Killer!

Frivolous lawsuits kill jobs. They
drain money and management time
from companies that should go into
research, development, and marketing.
They clog the courts and increase tax
costs. They hurt California’s reputa-
tion as a good place to do business.

The trial lawyers who wrote
Proposition 207 added a cosmetic frivo-
lous lawsuit provision that won’t be
used and can’t work. That’s no surprise.

But the trial lawyers also wrote
207 so that any future laws to crack
down on frivolous lawsuits can’t pass
the Legislature with less than a two-
thirds vote. Sneaky!

The trial lawyers want to tie the
Legislature’s hands totally when it comes
to overseeing their fees and attorney-client
contracts. Then they can write these as
they please without interference. The
prospect of extorting huge settlements and
taking huge fees is a tremendous incentive
to file frivolous lawsuits. Look at what's
happening with class-action litigation.
Proposition 207 is designed to prevent the
Legislature from ever interfering with the
fee part of these scams.

Proposition 207 may have been a
trial lawyer’s defensive tool when
written, but now it’s a JOB KILLER
TIME BOMB waiting to go off. 0
