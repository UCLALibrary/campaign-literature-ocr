Dear Friends,

Prop. A was developed by citizens to improve our quality of

life and give children in every community in Los Angeles

County safe places to play.

Prop. A funds more than 140 specific neighborhood park

projects and gang prevention efforts. Prop. A will:

¢ Help prevent gangs by giving young people positive
recreational alternatives

¢ Repair run-down parks that are targets for crime and graffiti

¢ Help protect natural lands and clean up water quality in
Santa Monica Bay.

Prop. A provides strict fiscal safeguards — including an

Annual Independent Audit — to ensure that the money will be

spent as promised.

Prop. A will improve our neighborhoods and give our children
safe places to play.

I urge you to vote YES on A on Nov. 5th.

Peter Ueberroth :

} Citizens for Safe Neighborhood Parks, A Project of People for Parks, Yes on Prop. A.
