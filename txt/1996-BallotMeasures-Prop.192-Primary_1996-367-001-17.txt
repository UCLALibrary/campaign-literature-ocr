THE IMPACT OF THE SCHOOL BOND MEASURE (PROPOSITION 203)
ON THE SEISMIC BOND MEASURE CAMPAIGN

A $3 billion school bond measure -- designated Proposition 203 — was added to the March
26 primary election ballot in early January. j

Does this have much impact on Proposition 192? Yes, but it is likely to be minimal. Here’s
why:

@ Proposition 203 and will be the LAST statewide measure on the ballot. Proposition 192 is
the FIRST statewide measure on the ballot — ten ballot measures fall between the two bond
measures.

This works to our advantage because voters are more likely to vote YES on bond measures
closer to the top of the ballot.

Also, bond measures are usually grouped together on the ballot. Voters tend to scan the
group as a whole, weigh the differences between the measures, and choose only those that
have the greatest appeal. Separating the measures stops this practice and provides an
important boost.

fa We were able to improve the language voters will see on the ballot when they cast their
votes.

The improved language — which is more specific - was tested in our polling and increased
support by five to seven points.

Having the strongest language possible in the ballot is a great asset. This improved language
helps our effort considerably.
