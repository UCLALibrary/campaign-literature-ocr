Forbes on the Move

FORBES FINISHES FIRST
IN ARIZONA AND DELAWARE PRIMARIES

Steve Forbes won his second
primary in Arizona on
February 27, after winning in
Delaware on February 24.
Forbes led the Arizona ballot-
ing with 33% of the vote fol-
lowed by Bob Dole and Pat
Buchanan further back. Forbes
captured all of the state’s 39
convention delegates in the
winner-take-all contest.

In Delaware, Forbes cap-
tured a third of the vote fol-
lowed by Dole at 27% and
Buchanan with 19%. Bob
Dole’s second defeat in as
many outings led to further
doubts about his ability to beat
Bill Clinton in November.

People voting for Forbes
cited his flat tax and the fact
that he was not a career
politician as their primary

reasons for supporting him. ,
They also believed that Forbes
has a vision for the future and
that his personal wealth keeps
him free from special interest
influence. The twin victories
show broad support for
Forbes’ campaign message of
growth, hope and opportunity.

FORBES WINS NEW YORK

favor of Steve Forbes’ right to
appear on the ballot invall of
New York’s 31 congressional

Bob Dole and had hoped to

ECONOMICS EXPERTS
AGREE, THE FLAT TAX
MAKES SENSE

An article appearing in the
February 22, 1996 Wall Street
Journal listed the opinions of
several of the nation’s leading
economic experts regarding
the implementation of a flat
tax. Among the benefits of the
flat tax cited by the experts
are increased economic
growth, ending manipulation
of the tax code in exchange
for political support, and a
simpler, fairer tax system.

“The basic structure of the
flat tax — tightly integrated
business and personal taxes
— offers a recipe for
a uniform, simple, airtight,
fair system.”
David F. Branford,
Professor of Economics,
Princeton University

“It would make it difficult, if
not impossible, to manipulate
the tax code to favor, or
punish, special interests.”

Milton Friedman,

1976 Nobel laureate

in Economics

“Every economist believes
that a flat tax would raise
economic growth: we differ
on the magnitude of the
effect... The flat tax is a
