SMRR

We started with rent control. But we didn’t stop there.

In the late 1970’s, Santa Monica
EVENINSSUUTLUUK | was being torn apart by hyper-
= fe inflation in the rental housing
market. Speculators bought and
sold apartment buildings, jacked
up the rents at will, evicted
tenants for no cause, converted
buildings to condos, or simply
tore them down for luxury
housing. Neighborhoods and
homes were literally being
destroyed.

Santa Monicans for Renters Rights grew out of a grassroots
campaign to pass rent control and eviction protections. In
April 1979, SMRR, with the active support of thousands of
residents, passed Santa Monica’s rent control law.

After 18 years, the effects of rent control have been
remarkably positive. Unlike other Westside communities,
Santa Monica has retained it’s vibrant mix of high, middle
and low income families, young and old. By stabilizing the
population, rent control has helped foster a sense of
community. Rent control made it possible to work together
with landlords to create programs that allow thousands of

renters to buy their apartments, and permanently preserve
our city’s affordable housing.

SMRR has defended the rent control law from attack, locally,
at the state level and in the courts. Last year, however, the
real estate lobby in Sacramento passed a bill which will phase-
n “vacancy decontrol” in the Santa Monica
rent control law — which historically has led to
harassment and unfair evictions. SMRR will
fight to lessen the impact of this bill.
