Ei Your vote for Barry Gordon is critical to

protect a woman’s right to choose.

Newt Gingrich and his Radical Right friends in Congress are trying to
take away a woman’s right to choose. They also want to turn back the
clock on family planning programs, health care, educational reform
and gun control. Unless the Democrats regain control of Congress
this year, the Radical Right could very well succeed.

That’s why the National Organization for Women and Women For:
urge you to vote for Barry Gordon for Congress.

NOW carefully researched this race. We found that Barry Gordon is
the candidate that we trust to fight for us - because Barry is the

President of the Screen Actors Guild, Barry effectively fought against
sexual harassment and the discriminatory “glass ceiling.” As a
community leader and co-founder of the Coalition for Health Security,
Barry has fought to protect a woman’s right to choose and for
affordable health care. As our next Congressmember, Barry will fight to
make educational funding a top priority, for better jobs, for a
comprehensive crime fighting plan, and to keep government out of
our personal decisions.

Now more than ever, we need Barry Gordon’s leadership in Congress.
On March 26, help make a difference for women throughout America
- elect Barry Gordon to Congress.
