Quackenbush was elected as Insurance Commissioner through almost three million dollars
in insurance contributions. Over ninety percent (90%) of the financing for this
initiative comes from the insurance industry.

Consumer groups have unsuccessfully urged Quackenbush to solve the real
insurance crisis, including the lack of affordable earthquake insurance and rising small
business and auto insurance rates. This Proposition is not the answer. Even some major
insurance companies admit Prop. 213 wonâ€™t solve the insurance crisis.

. 213 Could Cos ABillio

Since one-third of auto accident victims cannot afford auto insurance and will not
get medical care under Proposition 213, local counties and hospitals will have to absorb
emergency assistance costs that can run up to a billion dollars a year. It will be paid by
taxpayers and could raise your taxes. (Insurance companies are totally exempt from
paying income taxes.)
