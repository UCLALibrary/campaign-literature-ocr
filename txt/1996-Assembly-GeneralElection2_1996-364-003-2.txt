California State Senate
Robert G. Beverly

Senator

October, 1996

Dear Friend:

I strongly endorse Councilman Dan Walker for election to the California State Assembly.

Prior to my election to the State Legislature, I served as a city attorney, councilman and
mayor. Understanding local government and having first-hand knowledge of the unique
problems facing your local community are important qualities for being an effective
state legislator.

Dan Walker possesses these qualities.

Dan is serving his fifth term on the Torrance City Council. He has the reputation of being
pro-business, pro-education and pro-environment. His record in support of the police has
earned him the endorsement of local law enforcement organizations.

Dan shares my belief that the funding of education must be our stateâ€™s highest priority,
with the money going into the classroom, not the bureaucracy.

While serving as a member of the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board,
Dan made the clean-up of the Santa Monica Bay and concern for our local environment
a top priority. .

Dan Walker has served the South Bay area with distinction. Please join with me in

supporting Dan Walker for Assembly... he has earned your vote.

Sincerely,

CLI

Robert G. Beverly
State Senator
