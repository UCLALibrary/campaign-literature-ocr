Dear Friend and Neighbor:

My grandmother had a saying, “You can't know where you're
going unless you know where you're from.” My husband Tony and |
take that lesson to heart. That's why we're committed to making
our neighborhoods better. After all, we're raising our children
here—we own a home here-my husband built his business here.

en Tony first consulted with me about running for
the State Assembly, I have to admit I thought twice. Tony has a
successful business, a happy marriage, and three great kids.
Why make the sacrifice?
But, when Tony told me that

convinced.
Capitol?
You can be sure Tony will take O

ow could they take our “Valley va ues” to the State

ur values,

with him to the state capitol. It all goes back to my grand-
mother's saying, “You can't know where you're going unless you
know where you're from.”

I want to tell you so many things about my husband:
that he's a successful pusinessman, that he helped start the first
domestic violence center in the Northeast Valley, that his
company adopted an elementary school in Arleta, that he talks
to kids at our local schools about staying out of gangs and off

drugs.
Most importantly,
He wants what we a want—sater streets,

etter schools an more jobs.

e he’s going ecause We no

Sincerely,

Norma Cardenas

Pp.s. I've enclosed a package of forget-me-not seeds to remind us

about the need to sow roots in our community and help improve
our environment.
