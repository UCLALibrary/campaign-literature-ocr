Empty Promises

John Geranios promises to represent you,

but in Sacramento, he'll he the tool of extremist
Republicans and corporate special interests who
are bankrolling his campaign.

> Bankrolled by corporations: Geranios takes thousands
in campaign contributions from oil companies, insurance
companies, polluters, developers and corporate lobbyists.
(CA Secretary of State, form 490, 1996)

> An extremist agenda: In a moment of rare honesty,
Geranios stated recently that he’d be “proud” to implement the
mean-spirited, extremist agenda of far-right Republican Assembly
Leader Curt Pringle. (Temple Sinai Candidate Forum, | 0/13/96)

>} Working for corporations, not for families: The
Geranios-Pringle agenda includes weakening penalties on
polluters, wiping out consumer safeguards, cutting the safety
net for kids and seniors, and giving huge tax loopholes to
wealthy corporations.

» Tax break for the rich: To pay back wealthy contributors,
Geranios supports a new tax break for the rich, a 15% tax cut
for families making more than $230,000 per year.

(Glendale News- Press, 7/1 1/96)

> Taking money from schools: Geranios will vote for the
tax break for the rich, even though it will take away millions of
dollars earmarked for our public schools.
(Glendale News-Press, 7/1 1/96)

» Against higher wages: Geranios opposes increasing
California’s minimum wage, as the first step to increasing wages
for everyone. (Glendale News-Press, 7/16/96)

The last thing we need in
Sacramento is another Empty Suit
