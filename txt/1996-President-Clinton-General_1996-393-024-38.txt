Aid for Disadvantaged Students

& The 1993 alternative budget offered by Bob Dole —
offered as a substitute for President Clinton’s budget
plan—would have cut elementary, secondary and
vocational programs by $2.7 billion over five years and
cut education for the disadvantaged by $174 million.
(Office of Management & Budget, 1993)

@ As Senate Majority Leader, Dole put his weight
behind House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s budget plan,
which included deep cuts in Title I (formerly Chapter I).
The cuts would have denied services to thousands of
young students and forced the layoff of 40,000 teachers
and paraprofessionals whose positions are funded by
Title I aid to local school districts. In March of this year,
Dole voted for an amendment to increase Title I funds.

@ Ifsigned into law, the Gingrich-Dole budget plan
would have cut 180,000 children from Head Start in six
years. Back in 1965, when the program was first created
and named Project Head Start, Dole voted against its
creation.

Safe and Drug-Free Schools

@ The budget plan supported by Dole last year cut the
President’s Safe and Drug-Free Schools program by
55% — reducing federal funds for curricula and pro-
grams developed locally by districts with the goal of
steering students away from drug and alcohol use. The
bill favored by Dole would-have cut programs that reach
23 million students.

Meeting High Standards

@ The Dole record in this area is mixed. Dole was one
of 17 co-sponsors of the 1991 bill creating the Bush
administration’s America 2000, which served as the
foundation for Goals 2000. However, last year Dole
supported a budget plan that would have eliminated the

Goals 2000 program. Under Goals 2000, each state
forms a panel made up of faculty, school employees,
administrators, parents and others who help set clear and
rigorous standards for students — and then determine
how to help students meet those standards. Dole recently
said Goals 2000 was “‘a bad idea when I voted against it
in the Senate. It’s a worse idea now.”

Private School Vouchers

@ Through the years, Dole has consistently supported
efforts to divert public tax dollars to private and/or
religious schools. In 1982, Dole himself wrote a bill to
give tax credits to parents who send their children to
private schools. One year later, Dole offered an amend-
ment that would have had the same effect. The measure
was defeated. In 1992, Dole voted for a bill that would
have used $30 million from the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act to fund vouchers to pay for education at
aprivate and/or religious institution. Just last year, Dole
voted for a pilot program to set up a similar voucher plan
in the District of Columbia.

(Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1982-83, 1992, 1995)

@ This year, Dole has proposed a $5 billion-a-year
‘voucher plan that would allow public tax dollars to be
used for private and parochial schools.

(New York Times, 7/19/65)

School Lunches

@ Until last year, Dole had a long record of support for
the federal school lunch program. However, in 1995,
Dole voted to support a measure that would have slashed
the school lunch program by $500 million and transfered
it to the states in the form of “block grants”. The bill
would have jeopardized school lunch eligibility for
millions of children. In 1974, Dole had co-sponsored
legislation to expand the school lunch participation.
