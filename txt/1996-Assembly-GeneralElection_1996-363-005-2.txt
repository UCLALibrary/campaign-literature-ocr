DAN WALKER GETS TAXPAYERS
TO PICK UP THE TAB.

Dan Walker has always traveled in style during his 17 years
on the Torrance City Council. He stays in luxury hotels,
indulges in room service, and dines at posh restaurants. Dan
Walker figures, why cut corners when he can just fork over
his bills to taxpayers like you?

Dan Walker calls himself a fiscal conservative, but as a City
Council member he sure doesn’t spend like one.

© Ona junket to Washington D.C., Dan Walker stayed at the
world-class Four Seasons Hotel, costing taxpayers
nearly $300 a night.

© On a junket to Atlanta, Dan Walker raided the mini-bar in
his Ritz Carlton hotel room, spending an outrageous
$52.60 in tax dollars in a single day. That’s a lot of
macadamia nuts!

e Dan Walker repeatedly exceeded his travel budget - then
“solved” the problem by sneaking through a Council
resolution to double his already generous annual travel

allowance.

Council
Makes Travel
a Ist-Class
Experience

Council members repres-
enting Torrance at out-of-
town conferences have stayed
at many nice places over the
years — Las Vegas, San Fran-
cisco and Yosemite National
Park among them.

But a look at the council
travel account nevertheless
reveals case after case of free
spending — and poor oversight.
Council members have often
picked posh and costly accom-
modations, and vigorously
defend their right to do so.

’ Walker defends hike in
Torrance travel allowance

After coming under fire from one of
his colleagues the night before,
Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker
on Wednesday defended his successful
motion that doubled the amount of
travel funds available to council

members.
Councilman Bill Applegate attacked
Walker’s effort as “unnecessary” and
said it was “out of line” to bring it up
as a non-agenda item when one council
member - Katy Geissert - was absent.
