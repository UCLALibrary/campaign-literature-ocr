I don't want to reform the tax code. I want to scrap
jt. Throw it out. Bury it. And replace it with a pro-
growth, pro-family tax cut that lowers tax rates to 17
percent for everyone -- the lowest effective tax rate since
Ronald Reagan's hero and mine, Calvin Coolidge.

That's important. But the heart of our proposal is the
most generous family deductions in two generations --
$13,000 for each adult and $5,000 for each child, so that a
family of four earning $36,000 pays not one cent in taxes.

All but eliminating the income tax for the average
American family -- that's our idea of real tax reform.

Next we take the value of money out of the hands of
the politicians and with sound money bring back the 4 and
1/2 percent mortgage rates our parent's generation took for
granted.

And that's just the beginning. As economic growth
and sound money bring in more revenues -- as they did in
the 1980s -- we will continue to cut taxes from the bottom
up, expanding family exemptions dollar for dollar for
every cut in the budget. That will make it dramatic for all
to see -- that every dollar Washington chooses to spend on
a pet project is coming right out of Americaâ€™s family
budgets. .

We're going to throw a wrench in the works of the
Washington spending machine and watch it grind to a halt.

Our program is your program, the same agenda that
the members of C-PAC have stood for since this
