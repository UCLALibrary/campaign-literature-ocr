This investigation in the Daily Breeze

blew open the relationship between
Dan Walker and Western Waste.

ROM New Orleans to Compton,

trash-hauler Western Waste has been
involved in scandal after scandal. Even
today, Western Waste is under FBI
investigation. But nothing ever stopped Dan
Walker from taking their money. Nothing.

Dan Walker started off his 17- year political
career with Western Waste money. And he
got more of it in his first re-election.

Dan Walker took more Western Waste
money after he pushed for a trash
monopoly in Torrance. After voters found
out about it, Dan Walker “promised” not to
take any more Western Waste money, but
he did — $21,000 worth.

Dan Walker kept taking Western Waste
money even after the company was fined
over $1 million for an anti-trust conspiracy
and toxic dumping in the San Gabriel
Valley. And he took even more after
Western Waste was convicted of bribery
and corruption in Oceanside.

Well, trash hauling is a “dirty” business —
but politics doesn't have to be. On
November 5, get the garbage out of politics.

Vote NO on Dan Walker.

On November 5th, get the
