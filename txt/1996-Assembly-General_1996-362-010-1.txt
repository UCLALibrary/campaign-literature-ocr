It was not an easy choice for Dr. Scott. With the

agonizing decision behind him, he will wrap UP
1995 at PCC and return to the classroom to share
his first-rate Jeadership skills with doctoral students
at Pepperdine University's Graduate School of Edu-
cation and Psychology in Culver City. It's back to
Pepperdine, where he began his career after a mas-
ter's degree in divinity at Yale University and @
doctorate in history at Claremont Graduate School.
Scott has been an outstanding leader at PCC be-

cause he understands that @ Jeader must communt-
cate a vision. He managed to do that while holding
at bay the downward-spiral funding forces that
harmed so much of California's once-great higher
education system. A major accomplishment at P
has been to implement a $100-million construction
program. ‘A landmark library and a much-neede
parking structure now stand as testament to Scott's
vision. Scott understands that the physical environ-
ment is important inan educational environment.

When students enter the campus they feel good
d themselves.
