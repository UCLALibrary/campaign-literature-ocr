Working Hard to Increase the Minimum Wage

“America Deserves a Raise”.

Decency and fairness demand that an honest day’s work mean an honest day’s pay.
Democrats support President Clinton’s proposal to increase the minimum wage from
$4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour over two years. This increase would reward the hard
work of the 10-14 million Americans who currently make the minimum wage and- nearly
3 million more who make within 60 cents of the minimum wage.

The purchasing power of the Minimum Wage will soon fall to its lowest real level in 40
years. Indeed, it is now 29% lower than it was in 1979 and has fallen nearly 50 cents in
real value since its last increase in 1991. The 90 cents an hour increase simply restores the
minimum wage to its value from the last increase.

Making ends meet is the never-ending challenge for America’s working families. This
increase in the minimum wage means about $1800 more a year. For a working family,
that’s 7 months of groceries, 4 months’ rent or mortgage payments, a full year of health
care (including prescription drugs), or 9 months of utility bills.
