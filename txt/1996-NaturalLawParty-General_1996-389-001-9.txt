ECONOMY PLATFORM

Unaccustomed to meaningful fiscal policy, the
Fed will have to be overhauled in order to allow
the economy to grow at a rate greater than 2.5%,
which is crucial to the prosperity and economic
security of all Americans. Creating new jobs
through economic growth is far more effective
than mere welfare reform in putting America
to work again.

Enterprise zones—The Natural Law Party sup-
ports the use of federally guaranteed loans to
stimulate capital investment for start-up indus-
tries in urban “enterprise zones.” By targeting
economically deprived urban areas, we can
stimulate economic growth where it is most
needed, thereby creating more jobs, a stronger
sense of community, and the revitalization of our
inner cities.

Cutting corporate health costs—The enor-
mous burden of corporate health care expendi-
tures can best be reduced by improving employee
health. Research shows that appropriate preven-
tive health care programs improve health and
reduce health care costs [8], thereby freeing fi-
nancial resources for greater productivity, profit,
and investment. Therefore, a Natural Law Party
government would encourage businesses to
implement such programs to improve corporate
health and productivity and to reduce employee
stress and substance abuse [9].

Creating macroeconomic stability through in-
creased social coherence—The Natural Law
Party also supports programs that have been
shown to dissolve social stress and conflict,
thereby providing a more positive and stable

14

environment for economic growth and prosper-
ity. Most analysts are aware of how businesses
are influenced by macroeconomic factors such
as inflation, unemployment, economic cycles,
and the threat of international conflict. However,
businesses are also in a position to change macro-
economic trends in a positive direction for the
benefit of the organization and society as a
whole. For example, research has found that even
a single group of 7,000 to 10,000 practitioners
of Transcendental Meditation and its advanced
programs can produce a significant decrease in
inflation and unemployment rates, as well as
improvements in other economic indicators [10].
Businesses that incorporate such programs into
their employee benefits packages help ensure
economic stability by creating a more coherent
and stable society.

Sharing the benefit—As the economy
improves, we anticipate higher pay, better work-
ing conditions, shorter work hours, and a shorter
work week. We believe that the American work
force should reap the benefits of a powerful
economy through a higher standard of living.

Through cost-effective solutions to the nation’s
problems, responsible tax reduction, and proven
programs to boost national intelligence and cre-
ativity, the Natural Law Party will propel the
economy into a sustained growth phase. This
pro-growth policy will simultaneously create
jobs, reduce unemployment, balance the budget
through increased government revenues, and
retire the national debt. Only the Natural Law
Party offers a comprehensive, viable strategy to
accomplish these goals.

Economic Model of Savings and Growth from the
Natural Law Party:
A Proposed United States Government Budget

The Natural Law Party would implement a pro-growth economic policy, with a balanced budget by
1999 and a low flat tax of 10% by 2002. Only the Natural Law Party can cut taxes deeply—and
responsibly—while protecting the integrity of our important social programs through the hundreds of
billions of dollars saved annually by our cost-effective solutions to crime, spiraling health care costs,
and other costly social problems. Simultaneously, by propelling the economy into a growth phase
without creating inflation, our policy will create jobs, reduce unemployment, and strengthen job
security.

The Natural Law Party flat tax computations follow Hall and Rabushka, The Flat Tax, 2nd ed., Stanford, CA: Hoover
Institute, 1995. Baseline data (1995-96) are based on Congressional Budget Office projections. This model assumes that
1) capital gains and other income are treated the same, 2) all businesses and individuals are taxed according to the same
flat rate, 3) no income above the basic allowance is exempt from the flat tax, 4) basic allowance is $16,500 for married
filing jointly; $8,250 for single; $4,500 for dependents, 5) individuals and families below poverty level pay no income
taxes, 6) the flat tax would not replace Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, and 7) no income would be taxed
twice. All data are expressed in constant 1995 dollars.

* Natural Law Party programs applied to increase growth to 3.5% per year (inflation adjusted). Historically, 5%
economic growth rates without inflation have resulted from major tax cuts (Hall and Rabushka, The Flat Tax, 2nd ed.,
Stanford, CA: Hoover Institute, 1995).

** Natural Law Party programs applied to reduce costs in these areas.
