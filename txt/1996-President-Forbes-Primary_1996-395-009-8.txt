If the American experiment is renewed and re-energized, we will astound
ourselves and the world with our opportunities and our achievements. The people of the
world will ask themselves and their governments, “If America can do it, why can’t we?”
By following our example and our principles, they will.

And I'll leave you with a final thought. Fifteen years ago, in 1980, the candidacy
of a man named Ronald Reagan was considered right here at this Press Club. And his
prospects seemed so bad that when you listed candidates and their support, he got an
asterisk. That’s pretty much where I’m starting. But, like Reagan, that’s not where I
intend to finish.

I thank you all very much. And now if you have any questions.
