PROP. 210 MAKES HARD WORK PAY
MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS SHOULD EARN MORE INCOME THAN PEOPLE ON WELFARE.

The current $4.75 / hour minimum wage punishes hard work.
Full-time minimum wage workers earn less income than those on welfare.
Work should pay better than welfare.

PROP. 210 WILL BOOST CALIFORNIA’S ECONOMY

Minimum wage workers spend every cent they earn on food, clothing and other basic necessities.
Prop. 210 gives consumers more money to spend, boosting California’s economy.
Rising wages mean increased sales and profits.

Hundreds of thousands of California jobs were created after the last increase in 1988.

Prop. 210 is sound economic policy, and is endorsed by 30 prominent California economists.
Many economic studies have demonstrated that a moderate increase in the minimum wage
has no adverse impact on jobs or inflation.
