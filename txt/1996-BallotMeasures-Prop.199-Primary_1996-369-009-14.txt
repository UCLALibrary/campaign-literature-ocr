b. Petition Fees

Petition fees, collected at the time a rent hearing is requested, are another common revenue
source for mobilehome rent control programs. Among the 41 jurisdictions that charge fees, their
amount and method of calculation varies greatly. Some jurisdictions charge fixed amounts. In
others the charge is based on the number of spaces in the park or is a combination of a fixed
amount and an additional fee per space.

In other jurisdictions, the fee is determined by the cost of the hearing, rather than being set
at a specific level. Alternatively, the fee may cover specified types of costs associated with
petition review, such as the costs of an expert or accountant, but not administrative staff costs.
Some jurisdictions divide the cost of the hearing between the parties, while others do not.

The fee provisions reported by each city are summarized in the table in Appendix A.
