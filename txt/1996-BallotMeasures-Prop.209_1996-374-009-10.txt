Thus, while on its first reading the initiative garners 71 percent support, support drops

changed. The upswing in the California economy has dampened a sense of frustration and
competition for scarce jobs, and voters' increasing Democratic partisanship accompanies a

protections for women simply goes too far. Voters ultimately find its effects unacceptable.
