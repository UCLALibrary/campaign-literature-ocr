TAXING TIMES

The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association

“Only the knowledge that the people
care will keep the politicians honest.”

Howard Jarvis 1903 — 1986

urges you to exercise your

rights as a citizen.

Vote YES on Proposition 218

on November 5, 1996 and guarantee
your right to vote on local taxes.

Because the people, not the politicians,
should have the right to approve new taxes!

loss of police and fire protection if
they pass Prop. 218. Countless citi-
zens could believe this lie and be
afraid to vote for Prop. 218.

Proposition 218 gives Californians
the right to vote on taxes, which
ensures certain key taxpayer protec-
tions guaranteed by the popular
Proposition 13.

Every informed Californian
should support Prop. 218. If Prop.
218 fails, local governments will
have a mandate to continue levying
taxes without a popular vote, perma-
nently undermining Proposition 13.

But Prop. 218 is at risk of fail-
ure, simply because of the over-
whelming financial advantage of its
pro-tax opposition.

Local governments are running
scared. In turn, they’re using scare
tactics, threatening voters with the

Other pro-taxers are using smear
tactics to sway voters against Prop.
218. These include lawyers who

feed from the public trough and
Wall-Street-style brokers who profit
from trading in government bonds
backed by assessments.

218 fails,

local governments will have a mandate to continue
levying taxes without a popular vote,
permanently undermining Proposition 13.”

Example #1: Stone and Young-
berg, an investment firm, issued a
report supposedly showing that
Prop. 218 would have “a devastat-
ing effect on local government
finance.” Stone and Youngberg has
refused to disclose how much they
profit from the bond market, but
they certainly have a vested interest
in the defeat of Prop. 218.

The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association (HJTA) has proven
that the report is full of exaggera-
tions and outright distortions.
Still, this report could scare count-
less more into voting “No on 218.”
HIJTA has been forced to spend
thousands of dollars to counter this
smear campaign.

Example #2: Pro-taxers have
spread the lie that Prop. 218 will
allow foreigners to vote in the
United States. This, too, could
frighten many voters away from
Prop. 218. And HJTA has had to

spend thousands of dollars getting
out the truth: that nothing in Prop.
218 would change the voting laws.

HJTA’s YES on 218 Project has
had to drain its campaign budget just
to shore up the damage done by
these smear campaigns. And now,
HJTA will have little or no money
left to counter any anti-218 assaults
in the last few days before
November Sth.

HJTA expects an anti-218
ambush in mid-October, probably as
you’re reading this newsletter. And
by this time; no money will be avail-
able to counter the assault, no matter
what forms it takes.

With so much at stake, and
Election Day so close, HJTA has a
challenge for everyone who has
saved money thanks to Proposition
13, to every Californian who wants
the right to vote on the taxes they
must pay, and to every HJTA
Member and supporter ...

YOUR CHALLENGE ...

Make a maximum effort to pass
Proposition 218. PLEASE send a
special contribution right now, your
personal investment in protecting
Proposition 13 and gaining the right
to vote on taxes!

funding needed to overcome smear
campaigns and late attacks, complete
