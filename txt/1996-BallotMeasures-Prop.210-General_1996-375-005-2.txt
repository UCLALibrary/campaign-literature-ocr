Who would Proposition 210 help?

In 1995, 1,600,000 California workers earned below $5.00 an hour. A total of 2,100,000
earned below $5.75 an hour. Thirty five per cent of workers earning below $5.75 an hour
work in retail trade. Other industries employing vast numbers of low wage workers include
agriculture, health care, hotels and restaurants and personal services.

Working women are more likely to earn low wages. Nineteen per cent of working women,
and sixteen percent of working men in California earn below $5.75 an hour. Eighty one per
cent of low wage workers are adults, not teenagers. Forty five percent are over the age of
thirty.*

Do other states have a higher minimum wage than California?

In recent years, California has had the lowest minimum wage on the west coast. The
minimum wage is $4.90 in Washington, and $4.75 in Oregon. Last year, Massachusetts
enacted a law which increases the minimum wage to $5.25 by Jan. 1, 1997. A November
1996 Oregon ballot initiative would raise that state’s minimum wage to $6.50 an hour over
three years. Initiatives to raise Montana’s minimum to $6.25 over four years, and Missouri’s
to $6.75 over three years, will also appear on the November ballot.

What do economists say about an increase in the minimum wage?

Last year, 101 distinguished economists from leading universities and research institutes
signed a statement calling for an increase in the minimum wage. The list of signers included
three Nobel laureates and seven past presidents of the American Economics Association.‘
Thirty California economists and business school professors have endorsed Proposition 210.
Princeton University economists studied the effects of the 1988 increase in California on
retail employment and the 1992 increase in New Jersey on fast food industry employment
and found employment levels increased after each state raised the minimum wage.° Oregon
and Washington have higher minimum wages, lower unemployment and lower child poverty
rates than California.

Will an increase in the state minimum wage lessen welfare dependency?

The Department of Social Services projects that an increase in the state minimum wage to
$5.75 an hour would sufficiently raise incomes of the working poor to reduce welfare
payments for about 50,000 recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children.°
