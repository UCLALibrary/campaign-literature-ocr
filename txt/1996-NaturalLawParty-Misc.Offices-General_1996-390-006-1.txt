Dear Friend,

Recently, our Natural Law Party representative in California, Cathy Carter,
spoke with you about setting up speaking engagements for Dr. John Hagelin,
our presidential candidate, and Dr. Mike Tompkins, our vice-presidential
candidate. Per Cathy’s request, I have enclosed information about the Natural
Law Party.

We want to set up these speaking engagements, with audiences of 100 people
or more, as soon as possible. If you know of an engagement coming up in the
next few weeks, please call me at our national headquarters, 515-472-2040, ext.
#120. ; >

Thank you for your interest in the Natural Law Party, America’s fastest
growing third party, now on the ballot in 48 states plus the District of
Columbia. We look forward to talking with you again soon, and hope we can
set up a speaking engagement with your group.

Sincerely,

Dd ngs Ore ParA—

Dean Draznin
Director of Fundraising
