REVITALIZING THE VALLEY’S ECONOMY

As small business person and member of the Valley Industry and Commerce
Association (VICA) and the Sherman Oaks Town Council, Bob is helping local
businesses. As an Assemblymember, Bob will vigorously work to cut through red
tape and to increase job opportunities in our neighborhood. Bob proposes a San
Fernando Valley Community Development Bank to leverage state and federal
funds to revitalize our local economy.

PRESERVING THE VALLEY’S PRECIOUS OPEN SPACE

Bob has worked hard to protect recreational opportunities and open space in the
San Fernando Valley. As President of Mulholland Tomorrow, Bob took on the big
real estate developers and stopped overdevelopment in the Santa Monica
Mountains. He supports preserving the Sepulveda Basin as a community park.

GIVING VALLEY PARENTS CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN SCHOOLS

As a parent of three, Bob knows the urgent need for educational reform — for
school-based management; for greater parent participation; and for local control.
That’s why Bob supports the breakup of the LAUSD. Bob thinks that if our kids
are to compete in the 21st century job market, California must do a better job of
investing in our youth today. As an Assemblymember, he will fight to make
educational funding a top priority in the State budget.

INCREASING PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE VALLEY

As a board member of the Los Angeles Alliance for a Drug Free Community, Bob
has helped rid neighborhoods of drug dealers. As an Assemblymember, Bob has
fought to put more police on our streets and to improve 9-1-1 services. Bob will
work to create a new Valley police station. He will assign a staff person to help
coordinate and expand Neighborhood Watch programs in Valley neighborhoods.
