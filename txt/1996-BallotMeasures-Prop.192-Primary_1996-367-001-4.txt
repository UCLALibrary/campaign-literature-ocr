What is the Seismic Retrofit Bond Act?

The Seismic Retrofit Bond Act -- Proposition 192 -- authorizes the sale of $2 billion of general
obligation bonds to strengthen California bridges and highway overpasses against failure in
future earthquakes. Approximately $650 million of the $2 billion budget would be used to
strengthen toll bridges throughout the state. Proposition 192 would eliminate the need to divert
funds from other critically needed transportation projects to provide earthquake safety
improvements.

Why was it proposed?

During the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern California, parts of the Bay Bridge and
Highway 880 freeway collapsed, killing and injuring scores of motorists. During the 1994
Northridge quake, more highway bridges failed, crippling emergency relief and commerce in for
weeks. Greater loss of life was avoided in part because highways were relatively empty during
the pre-dawn Southern California quake.

The next quake -- the Big One -- could come at any time, according to seismic experts.
Proposition 192 will strengthen more than 1,000 California bridges and highway overcrossings
identified as vulnerable to collapse to ensure they will not fail during that inevitable next major
earthquake.

What is retrofitting and how do we know it works?

In simple terms, seismic retrofitting entails the installation of giant sleeves that are welded over
highway and bridge support columns and reinforced with concrete walls at the base.
