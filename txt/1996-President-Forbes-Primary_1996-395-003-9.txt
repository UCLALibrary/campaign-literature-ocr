at zero percent, they would still show up for work on Monday. Some

propositions are so ridiculous only Washington could believe them.

As I say, there are many activists, particularly in the House,
who want to change things, but they can’t fight the culture -- without

a President who is fighting at their side. The few significant reforms
they do pass disappear when the bills go to that grand old

embodiment of the political culture in Washington, the Senate -- the
black hole of political reform.

Remember lawsuit reform, the effort to end the abuse of our
civil justice system by predatory trial lawyers? The House passed a
bill that protects all Americans. The Senate, presided over by,
well...not by Speaker Gingrich, was only able to pass a bill that
protects manufacturers -- that safeguards GM, as it should, but
leaves the rest of us -- small businessmen, service industries,
churches and volunteers, even the Girl Scouts, out in the cold.

Maybe, just maybe, it had something to do with the fact that
the trial-lawyer lobby gives more money to political candidates than
the three big auto makers and the ten largest oil companies combined.

Then there was welfare reform -- which once it got to the
Senate, was'stripped of crucial provisions to end government
subsidies of out-of-wedlock births.

All of this presided over by the consummate inside-the-Beltway
deal maker, the Leader of the Senate.

America can’t afford any more such deals. Like the dealers in
three-card monte, the government always wins and the taxpayer
always loses.

And what of Medicare reform?
