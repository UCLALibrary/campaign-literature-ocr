first Republican Presidential
Primary grew steadily as elec-
tion day approached. In the
end, Steve Forbes and his pow-
erful message of growth and
opportunity prevailed.
Arizonans sent a powerful
message — they support
Forbes’ Flat Tax Plan and they
believe that America’s best
days are ahead.

Vermont

Steve Forbes quietly filed
petitions with over 1700
signatures for the March 5
Presidential primary, more
than any other candidate!
This effort was completed by
enthusiastic volunteers in all
14 counties. The calls keep
coming in and the support for
Steve and his message of

growth, hope and opportunity
continues to grow. Our next
project will be letters to the
editor and planning for our
sign “bloom” before town
meeting day (primary day)
March 5S.

South Dakota

The Tuesday, February 27
South Dakota primary found
Steve Forbes in third place.
Bob Dole, who hails from
neighboring Kansas, won the
contest. Perhaps the most
important result was the
continued slide of Lamar
Alexander into the lower tier
of candidates. Alexander, who
has yet to place higher than
third in any race, slipped fur-
ther back in the pack.

One woman called our
headquarters and said,

Forbes, because I’ve never
heard him say anything I dis-
agree with. He’s the only one
out of the crowd who has any
common sense.”

Despite the liberal media,
we continue to believe that the
brilliant political commentator
Yogi Berra had it right when
he said, “It ain’t over ’til it’s
over.” We will continue to
work hard right on through to
the convention to help Steve
get out the only message that
counts: growth, hope and
opportunity.

Iowa

The Iowa caucuses
presented an organizational
challenge to identify leaders
and coordinate precinct level
campaigns in over 2,140
precincts. The other candi-
dates and their campaigns had

been in Iowa for more than a
year and a half before Forbes’
Iowa office was opened.

The extremely low turnout
in the Iowa caucuses — only
96,000 people participated out
of the 2 million-plus eligible —
affected the results in lowa.

The good news about the
Forbes campaign in Iowa that
has been underreported by the
media is that Forbes captured
enough votes for 3 delegates to
the national convention.

Steve Forbes attracted many
new people to the Republican
Party in Iowa, and many of
the Forbes supporters were
active in the caucuses for their
first time this year.

block other candidates from
even appearing on the ballot.

The Forbes campaign
mounted an aggressive petition
drive in order to meet the
state’s difficult entry require-
ments. The Dole machine
sought to have Forbes blocked
through a series of legal
maneuvers. Barring any further
attempts by the Dole support-
ers to overturn his decision,
Judge Edward Korman’s
February 21 ruling ensures
that New York Republicans
will have a choice in their
March 7 primary.

Steve Forbes

filed more signatures
than any other
candidate for the
Vermont Republican
presidential primary.

Steve Forbes on Social Security

“We must keep our promises to those who are on the sys-
tem and those who are going to go on the system in the next
15 years in terms of benefits. But we know — and younger
Americans know — that the system is going to go kaput by
the time they retire. So why not, while we still have time, do
something unusual 20 years ahead of time before the crash?
And that is have a new system for younger people, where a
portion of their payroll tax, instead of going to subsidize the
national debt in Washington, would instead go into their
own individual savings or retirement account.”

Talking points on the Forbes Plan to save Social Security

¢ If things are allowed to continue as they are, before the
next generation retires, the Social Security Trust Fund
will be bankrupt — the money workers put in today just
won’t be there.

¢ The politicians in Washington keep raiding the trust fund
to cover their deficit spending.

¢ Forbes’ plan calls for using the money that’s there now
to meet our current obligation to our retired and soon-to-
be retired citizens.

¢ People who are already receiving benefits or will retire
within the next 15 years will still get their checks.

¢ Younger workers will gradually be given the opportunity
to invest a portion of their money that now goes to
the Social Security trust fund into private investments of
their choice.

¢ The choice will be theirs; they will control their own
investments.

¢ The Forbes Plan will create a huge influx of capital into
the private sector where new businesses begin and jobs
are created.

¢ Without the trust fund to raid, Congress will be forced
to curtail deficit spending.
