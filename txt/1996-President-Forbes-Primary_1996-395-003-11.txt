Number one was “to use my skills, abilities,” followed by
“control my own life,” “build for the family,” “liking the challenge,”
and “live where and how I want to live.”

That is the true voice of America. That is the free, independent
spirit that has made this nation a light unto the world, a model of
freedom and economic growth.

And it is a voice running directly contrary to the controlling
impulses of an ever demanding big government and the political
class that runs it.

America is at a fork in the road: we can give in to those
demands, let ourselves be run -- and run into the ground -- by the
political class, just as other nations have done before us. Or, as
Americans have always done, we can chose a future in which
government is smaller, and America is bigger -- with more freedom,
growth, opportunity and hope for everyone.

With lower taxes, lower interest rates, less regulation -- we can
give the private sector the tools it needs to do the job.

Let's free up free enterprise in this land again.

That is the America I want; that is why I have started up this
campaign, this venture in entrepreneurial politics. If it is the America
you want, I urge you to join me. One man is not the issue here, the
future of our nation is.

Thank you all very much.
