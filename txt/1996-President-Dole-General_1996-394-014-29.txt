Clinton Has Abandoned the War on Drugs

Democrat Congressman Charles Rangel (former Chairman of the Select Committee on Narcotics):
‘I ve been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any Administration
= that’s been so silent on this great challenge to the American people.”
CNN News, January 31, 1994.

Clinton’s actions speak louder than words

° Days after taking office, Clinton cut the White House drug office staff by 83%.
* Clinton did not name a “drug czar” until July of 1993, leaving the post vacant for 7 months.

* Clinton’s National Security Council dropped the drug war from one of the top three
priorities to Number 29 on a list of 29.

* In 1993, Clinton cut drug interdiction efforts by nearly $231 million.

¢ From 1992 to 1995, Clinton eliminated 227 agent positions from the DEA.

* Clinton adopted a policy of releasing and sending back to Mexico drug smugglers intercepted at
our border with less than 100 pounds of marijuana on their body.

* The Clinton Administration, under objection from the Secret Service, issued permanent
White House passes to employees who admitted to having used illegal drugs--
including crack, cocaine and LSD---with some frequency.

Bill Clinton has also appointed officials with very curious views relating to drugs

* Joycelyn Elders, Surgeon General: publicly suggested that we legalize drugs.

¢ Mike McCurry, White House spokesman: “I was a kid in the 1970s. Did I smoke a joint from
time to time? Of course, I did.” White House press briefing, July 16, 1996.

¢ Janet Reno, Attorney General: has spoken out against stiff minimum sentences that are
mandatory for drug offenders and has complained that there are too many dealers in prison.

The Results of Clinton Drug Policy

* After 13 straight years of decline, drug use among 12-17 year-olds has risen 105% since Bill
Clinton was elected.

¢ Teen marijuana use has risen 141%.

° Between 1994 and 1995 alone,
Use of LSD rose 54%
Cocaine use rose 166%
Marijuana use rose 37%.

° We have also seen a dramatic increase in emergency room visits since Bill Clinton has been
elected; cocaine emergency room admissions are at the highest levels ever reported

Bill Clinton does not seem to believe we have a serious drug problem in this country, even when
Statistics hauntingly show otherwise. We can no longer afford to have a President who, when asked
by a young person on MTV, “If you had it to do over again, would you inhale?” answers with
laughter “Sure, if I could. I tried before.”
