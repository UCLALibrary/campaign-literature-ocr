John Geranios

John Geranios was asked one simple question:

“Do you live in the district where you are running for office?”

Instead of giving us a simple answer...

John lied once... You see, Geranios has lived for years in the
Hollywood Hills outside our district. So when he was asked “Where
do you live?,” he had to come up with a quick answer.

“| live at my grandmother’s house in Glendale,” said John.

John lied twice... In fact, John Geranios didn’t live there; he’d
only registered to vote there. How do we know? Because when the
Registrar of Voters sent him some mail at that address, it was
returned with the words “not here” scrawled across it.

Caught in the act, John needed another quick answer. “l live at my
grandmother's house in Glendale three days a week and I rent an
apartment in Burbank for privacy,” said John.

John lied a third time... Then, the Glendale News-Press
asked one of John’s grandmother’s neighbors whether he lived there
or not.“‘No, he hasn't lived there,” she said.“‘He lives in Toluca Lake.”
The neighbor also added that his grandmother herself spent very lit-
tle time at that address.

John’s answer to that? “Maybe she’s staying with my parents right now,”
said John, who should have known, since he was supposedly staying with
her three days a week.

and then John lied again... Geranios told the News-Press in
March that his Grandmother’s house in Glendale was his “primary
residence.” It turns out, Geranios filed forms with the L.A. Tax
Collector saying his “primary residence” was his home in the
Hollywood Hills - not just in March, but all the way until August.

Now, you might not really care where John Geranios lives.

But here’s a question you should care about:

Should you send someone to Sacramento who can’t even tell the truth about where he lives?
