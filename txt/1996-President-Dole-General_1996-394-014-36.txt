FOREIGN POLICY
In contrast to the rudderless foreign policy of the Clinton administration, the

Platform continues the Republican Party’s recognition that Democracy is the guarantor of

peace in.a dangerous world. It therefore pledges to vigorously support restoring the
promotion of democracy worldwide as a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy. The Platform
calls for:

An expansion of NATO no later than 1998 to include Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary.

Supporting America’s men and women in uniform who are serving in Bosnia and
Herzegovina while looking forward to their timely withdrawal.

Encouraging Russia to respect the sovereignty and independence of its neighbors.
Reaffirming the Republican Party’s commitment to the independence of ail those
formerty captive nations still recovering from the long night of Soviet Communism.
Support for Israei’s efforts to find peace and security with its neighbors and for
Israel’s right to make its own decisions regarding security and boundaries.
