Gi Your vote for Bob Hertzberg is needed to
protect a woman's right to choose. HJ

Right-wing Republicans have taken over the State Assembly. Their first
priority is to take away a woman’s right to choose. They are also attempting
to turn back the clock on family planning programs, health care,
educational reform and gun control.

We must fight back by electing Assemblymembers who will have the guts to
take on the Radical Right and protect our rights.

That is why the National Organization for Women /San Fernando Valley-
PAC and Women For: have endorsed Bob Hertzberg for State Assembly.

NOW carefully researched and interviewed both candidates. Bob Hertzberg
is the one we trust to fight for the issues we care about. Now more than ever,
we need courageous, creative leaders like Bob Hertzberg in the Assembly.

On March 26, vote to protect your right to choose. Vote for Bob Hertzberg
and make the difference for women throughout California.

Vote March 26.
Make a difference for women
throughout California
