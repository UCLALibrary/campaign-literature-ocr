One of Bob Dole’s and my highest priorities is to ensure that every American has access
to a quality education. That is why he developed a plan to give parents a $500 per child
tax credit and create special, tax-free bank accounts for them to save money for their
children’s education.

Bob Dole and I are also committed to stemming the tide of crime in America. In this
country, a crime is committed every two seconds and drug use by teenagers has doubled
in the past four years, That is not acceptable. Bob Dole has a tough 5-point plan to
reduce violent crime and drugs use.

But this election is about our future more than about our problems. It is about Bob Dole
and his vision for more opportunities for all Americans through lower taxes, better jobs
and higher wages. It is about his vision of a smaller, more efficient government with
strong, smart programs that empower both poor and middle-class Americans. It is about
his vision of stronger and safer families benefiting from tax relief, secure and drug-free
neighborhoods and more educational opportunities.

Bob Dole is the kind of world-class leader that can bring America together in a spirit of
confidence and optimism, and prepare us to surpass our greatest expectations in the 21st
century. In the words of General Colin Powell, “Bob Dole is a man of strength, maturity
and integrity. He is a man who can bring trust back to the government and bring America
together again . .. Bob Dole is the candidate most qualified by virtue of his beliefs, his
character and his competence to be the next President of the United States of America.”

So during the next several weeks, listen to the political debates, visit our Web Site at

election for you and for your family. I am confident that you will agree with Colin Powell
and millions of Americans who believe that Bob Dole is the better man, for a better
America.
