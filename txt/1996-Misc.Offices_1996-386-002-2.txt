BUILDING TO WIN, BUILDING TO LAST

Dear union member:

We are writing to you about three important ballot
propositions that affect you.

Proposition 210 is sponsored by your local union—
and all California unions. It would raise the state
minimum wage to $5 an hour on March 1, 1997, and to
$5.75 in 1998.

The new $4.75 federal minimum wage still leaves a
California family of three $3,100 below the poverty
line. Today, men and women who work full time for the
minimum wage earn less than those on welfare. That's
wrong.

Please vote "Yes" on Proposition 210.

+ Proposition 209 would do more than wipe out
affirmative action. It would kill all programs
offering equal opportunity for women and minorities.

Proposition 209's three main backers are Governor
Pete Wilson, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and
House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Wilson, Duke and Gingrich
have opposed the rights of women and minorities.
They've spent their careers fighting unions.

Now Wilson, Duke and Gingrich call Proposition 209
a "civil rights" initiative. Who do they think they're
fooling?

Please vote "No" on Proposition 209.

- Proposition BB is badly needed in Los Angeles to
repair and upgrade our kids' aging and overcrowded
schools. Too many are worn out and unsafe. None of
this money can go to pay administrators or staff.

Please vote "Yes" on Proposition BB.

On Tuesday, Nov. 5, please join the Los Angeles

County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO in voting "Yes" on
Proposition 210, "No" on Proposition 209 and "Yes" on

Proposition BB. FE
Fraternally, 7.’ /
