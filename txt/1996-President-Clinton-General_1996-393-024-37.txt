e Clinton Record

Creating High-Wage Jobs

& Since President Clinton assumed office, unemployment
has fallen from more than 7 % to only 5.4 %. Home
ownership among Americans is at its highest level in 15
years. Also, 1.2 million fewer Americans are living in
poverty since the President took office in 1993.

Orlando Sentinel, 1049/95)

@ Before taking office, Bill Clinton pledged to help turn
the economy around and produce 8 million new jobs. By
the summer of this year, President Clinton had met — and
surpassed — this goal. His policies helped create more
than9 million new jobs.

(Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1996)

® Inaddition to more jobs, the economic recovery under
President Clinton has created better jobs at high wages.
Ananalysis by chief economist Mark Zandi found that
45% of the new jobs created last year — nearly half —
paid above-average wages. This is compared to 1993, the
year Clinton took office, when only 33 % of new jobs paid
above-average wages. In President Bush’s last year of
Office, only 22 % of new jobs paid wages that were above
the national average. In his analysis of the Clinton recov-
ery, Zandi wrote: “The quality of jobs being created is
steadily increasing.”

Deficit Reduction

@ Inless than four years under Clinton, the federal budget
deficit — which had more than tripled during the 1980s —
is now less than half of what it was in 1992. That year
(Bush’s final year in office) the deficit was $290 billion.
The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the
deficit for 1996 will be less than $117 billion, falling 60 %
in only four years. Measured as a share of the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) — representing the size of the
economy — the deficit under Clinton is at the lowest level
since 1974.

ECONOMIC RECOVERY

Affordable Home-Buying

@ Under President Clinton, Americans have found buying
anew home more affordable. Over the past four years,
the average sale price of a new home has risen more
slowly than inflation —a big change from the soaring
prices of the 1980s that made home-buying difficult for
many families. Under Clinton, the rate of home owner-
ship (64.7 %) is at its highest rate in 13 years.

(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1996; U.S. Department of Labor, 1996)

Fewer Welfare Recipients
@ Today, there are 1.3 million fewer people collecting
welfare than there were when President Clinton first took
Office.
