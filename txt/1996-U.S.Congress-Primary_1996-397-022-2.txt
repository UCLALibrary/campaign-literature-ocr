“Then there’s Doug Kahn, an heir to the
Annenberg publishing fortune, who ae
already put $400, (000 into his upcoming, : a
third, bid for the congressional seat now e
by US. Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R-

Glendale). ae who pet $140,000 run-

sood investme ae
children to do this,” he said.

But Doug Kahn doesn’t own a
business.

He doesn’t even have a job.

Unlike the vast majority of the people he wants to
represent, Doug Kahn doesn’t work for a living.
He doesn’t own a business and he doesn’t even
have a job. But you won't find him living in a
cardboard box underneath the 210 Freeway. You
see, he inherited millions of dollars from his
relatives, the Annenberg family, who built a billion

dollar financial empire based on horse racing and
publishing.

Doug Kahn is a full-time
politician — running for office
with his family's money.

Fortunately, Doug Kahn has found a hobby to
occupy his idle hours — running for office. He
started out small, running for City Council in
Seattle, Washington. He lost, badly, so he moved
to Pasadena and started running for office here.
This year he’s running for Congress — for the third
time in four years. He’s already spent over
$600,000 of his family’s money on his incessant
campaigns — but there’s plenty more where that
came from.

Doug Kahn claims to he a

compassionate community volunteer.

This is the house that Doug Kahn was living
in when he sued a retarded neighbor for
$10 million.

Doug Kahn brags about his membership in local
charities — but on July 14, 1995 Doug Kahn
showed us a different, less charitable, side.

It seems that a retarded adult living in a
residential care home next door to Doug Kahn
threw a rock at Kahn’s house and broke a window
in an empty room. Kahn called the police and
filed a complaint — and then he sued the retarded
adult and the owner of the home for $10,000,000
for “emotional distress” and “assault.”

In December 1995, Kahn bought a million dollar
house in the Arroyo section of Pasadena. Even
though he has moved miles out of rock-throwing
range, he has continued to press his lawsuit.

In December, Doug bought this million dollar
house in Pasadena, but has continued his
suit against his former neighbor.
