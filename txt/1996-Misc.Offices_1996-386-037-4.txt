MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE.
INITIATIVE STATUTE.

Fiscal Impact on Government Agencies, Jobs and the Economy

Increase in state and local government costs of more than $300 million due to higher
costs of providing welfare services.

Tens of millions of dollars for additional unemployment and AFDC payments due to
layoffs of minimum wage workers.

66,000 jobs would be lost.

¢ Put tens of thousands of minimum wage workers out of work and on to unemployment
and welfare rolls.

(J) NO. A NO VOTE WOULD:

¢ Leave the recently approved 22% increase in the minimum wage intact.

business.
