category of individuals who cannot be reached. Crime control policy, there-
fore, should be flexible, with a range of programs designed for the needs of
aifferent kinds of offenders. The unemployment benefits provided under Senate
Bill 224 fit into this overall strategy of crime control. There are apparently
jarge numbers of ex-offenders whose prospects for law abiding behavior can
be significantly enhanced with modest amounts of "transitional aid” made avail-
able through the State unemployment system. This is not to say that all ex-
offenders will be assisted by the program, or that the "cure" is 100% effective.
However, it is to say that the chances of recidivism can be substantially
reduced in a cost-effective manher. All of the evidence from our evaluation
indicates that unemployment benefits like those mandated by Senate Bill 224

~ should become a routine ‘part of California's response to crime.
