and social stress, the Natural Law Party can im-
prove the effectiveness of such behavioral-modi-
fication programs by significantly enhancing
compliance. In this way we can achieve a last-
ing social transformation toward more life-sup-
porting, health-promoting behavior among our
citizens.

The Natural Law Party is unique in offering high-
quality health care for all, while providing a net
cost savings for the nation.

NOTES

1. The “miracles” of modern medicine have been
much less effective in producing health than
most Americans have assumed, according to
mortality and morbidity rates in the United States
(see International Journal of Health Sciences
19(2):181-208, 1989). To date, 43 million Ameri-
cans suffer from high blood pressure;
7 million are afflicted with heart disease; over
75,000 will die of AIDS; almost 400,000 will
die this year of smoking-related disease; and an
estimated 23 million suffer from cognitive, emo-
tional, or behavioral disorders.

2. The U.S. has the fifth highest infant mortality
rate and the highest low-birthweight among the
23 industrial nations belonging to the Organiza-
tion of Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD). The U.S. also ranks very low among
OECD nations for life expectancy at birth—20th
for males and 18th for females (Health Affairs,
Fall: 100-112, 1994).

4. Nearly 47% of premature deaths among
Americans could have been avoided by changes
in individual behaviors and another 17% by
reducing environmental risks, according to a
1994 assessment by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. In contrast, the study
suggested that only 11% of premature deaths
could have been prevented by improved access
to medical treatment. (See CDC, Ten Leading
Causes of Death in the United States, Update,
Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 1994).

5. Only 1% of our health sector budget is used
to avoid disease, while 99% is spent to treat ill-
ness after it occurs. Astonishingly, the Federal
Government also subsidizes unhealthy influ-
ences on our nation. For example, even though
tobacco use is known to cause 400,000 deaths
per year, including 3,000 from passive smok-
ing, the U.S. Government subsidizes the tobacco
industry. Our government also provides fund-
ing for genetic engineering and supports the
nonlabeling of genetically engineered foods—
despite the potentially serious health risks of such
foods and the absence of research on long-term
environmental effects (see our “Agriculture”
section). Furthermore, the current Congress cut
funding for the Environmental Protection
Agency by 27% in 1995, despite the link be-
tween industrial pollution and disease suggested
by the rising incidence of cancer in American
and other industrialized nations.

6. This health care option would be available to
Medicare and Medicaid subscribers under a
voucher system. Medical savings accounts es-
tablish an annual sum to cover subscriber health
care costs; any unused portion of the account is
paid directly to the subscriber each year. These
accounts thus encourage savings and discour-
age unnecessary use of the health care system.
However, this health care option also provides
for catastrophic coverage at rates similar to tra-
ditional insurance plans in order to protect sub-
scribers facing unexpected health care costs.

8. Real preventive health care averts disease be-
fore it arises—and recent studies indicate that
specific programs of behavioral prevention pro-
duce large cost savings.

¢ A 10-year study by the University of Michi-
gan at Steelcase Corporation reported that
systematic programs of diet, exercise, and
stress reduction, when targeted for subjects in
high-health-risk categories, reduce total health
care costs by 46% (see Medical Tribune 14,
February 10, 1994).

¢ A program designed by Dr. Dean Ornish and
used in a number of American hospitals has
consistently shown that systematic use of diet,
exercise, and meditation in combination can
clear clogged arteries—promising large sav-
ings over the average $20,000-$50,000 cost
of angioplasty and bypass surgery (see Jour-
nal of the American Medical Association
274:894-901, 1995; Lancet 336:129-133,
1990; and American Journal of Cardiology
69: 845-853, 1992).

¢ Research on the Transcendental Meditation
program has consistently demonstrated both
cross-sectional and longitudinal health ben-
efits. A five-year study of 2000 subjects has
shown that people who practice TM have
health care utilization more than 50% lower
than matched control groups. The reductions
were greatest in the oldest age group (aver-
aging 67% lower) and in high-cost areas (the

21

TM group needed 76% less surgery and suf-
fered 87% less heart disease) (Psychosomatic
Medicine 49: 493-505, 1987). A recent study
on hypertension in elderly African-Americans
found that Transcendental Meditation was
twice as effective in reducing high blood pres-
sure as progressive muscle relaxation and
about equally as effective as medication, but
without harmful side effects (Hypertension
26 (5):820-827, 1995). A further study found
that Transcendental Meditation was more
cost-effective in the treatment of hyperten-
sion than any of five classes of hypertensive
drugs studied (American Journal of Managed
Care 2(4): 427-437, 1996). And a longitudi-
nal study of 677 health insurance enrollees
in Quebec showed that health care utilization
declined between 5% and 7% per year after
the subjects learned the Transcendental Medi-
tation program (American Journal of Health
Promotion 10(3): 208-216, 1996).
