Facts About the California Civil Rights Initiative

Why is CCRI Needed?

To end the regime of race- and sex-based quotas, preferences and set-asides now governing state
employment, contracting and education due to years of court decisions and bureaucratic regulations. The
noble goal of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- equality before the law -- has been twisted into
government-sanctioned discrimination. This system violates the fundamental principle of equal protection
of the law against discrimination on the basis of the immutable characteristics of race, sex, color, ethnicity
and national origin. CCRI is needed to end this wasteful and divisive system and restore color-blindness
to California law and government. CCRI will help make the California Constitution an instrument of
unity, not division.
