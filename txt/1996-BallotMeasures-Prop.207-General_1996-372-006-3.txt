SMOKE ALREADY BLOWING AWAY FROM PROPOSITION 207

Sacramento, CA...With 10 weeks remaining before the November 5 election, the smoke
is already blowing away from the trial lawyers’ attempt to prohibit future legislative

oversight of their contingency fees and contracts. 7

The respected California Journal in its just-published September issue summarizes that:
“Proposition 207 would protect attorneys’ ability to charge virtually unlimited contingency
fees and make it difficult for the Legislature to put a cap on such fee arrangements.” (see
attached)

John H. Sullivan, president of the Association for California Tort Reform and chair of the
Coalition Against Unfair Attorneys’ Fees, the committee formed to defeat Proposition
207, said:

“Tt is ironic that within months of changing their name to ‘consumer attorneys,’ the trial
lawyers launched a second fraud on the public by drafting this anti-consumer initiative
disguised as limits on frivolous lawsuits and excessive attorney fees.

“Their so-called ‘limits’ either restate existing rules or are written to be totally ineffective.
Voters will recognize that letting the trial lawyers write laws on frivolous lawsuits is like
letting Dracula run the blood bank,” Sullivan said,

A key question for the trial lawyers to answer is, if they are suddenly so concerned with
frivolous lawsuits, why haven’t they worked in the Legislature to propose and support
laws to protect the public from meritless litigation?

Opponents of Proposition 207 include the Consulting Engineers and Land Surveyors of

California, California Chamber of Commerce, California Business Properties Association,
Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, and the National Federation of Independent

Business.
