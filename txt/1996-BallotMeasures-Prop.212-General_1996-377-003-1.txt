POLITICS
CAN BE
SPACKY

But this Halloween, it’s the Sacramento special
interests who are getting a scare, as they contemplate

Proposition 212, the toughest campaign finance
reform law in America.

Prop. 208, a second measure on the ballot, doesn’t
stand a ghost of a chance of scaring anybody.

In fact, 208 is kind of tricky even to understand.
But Prop. 212’s a real treat.

Prop. 208 allows politicians to keep raising all of
their campaign cash from special interests outside
their districts.

TREAT

Prop. 212 forces candidates for political office to
raise at least 75% of their contributions from their
own constituents.

Prop. 208’s high contribution limits, which will
double 95% of the time, favor wealthy special
interests.

TREAT

Prop. 212 puts ordinary citizens first by limiting
contributions to $100.
