Dear Friend,

We enthusiastically support Larry Gallagher
for re-election to the West Basin Water
Division 5 on November 5th.

Larry has fought to keep our water rate in
check, he has brought 2,500 new local jobs to
our area, and he will continue to be our local
voice, protecting us from government
bureaucrats who don't care about our
neighborhoods.

On election day, join us in casting your vote
for Larry Gallagher, The Community's Choice.

Sincerely,
