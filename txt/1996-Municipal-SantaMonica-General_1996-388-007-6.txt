Arts, Parks and Services.

Our parks should be the pride of our community. SMRR is
committed to the expansion and restoration of all park
facilities. SMRR City Council majorities and community
activists have pushed for the lovely renovations of Lincoln
Park, Palisades Park, Virginia Park, Clover Park, and the
development of a new beach front park in Ocean Park.
Upgrading Douglas Park and implementing a beachfront
master plan are next on the list.

SMRR will work to expand park space and recreational
facilities on unused city land, such as vacant land at the
Santa Monica airport.

In 1981, SMRR leaders initiated the Santa Monica Arts
Commission and public arts program. Santa Monica is now
world-recognized as a
center of arts and culture,
boasting the most
extensive collection of
museums, galleries, and
studios west of Manhattan.
The Arts not only enrich
our community, but
invigorate our local
economy. SMRR is
committed to an expansion of the arts,
particularly the performing arts, and the development of a
world-class arts program in our schools.

SMRR has also promoted one of the state’s most
comprehensive systems of services for senior citizens,
including housing, transportation, recreation, education, and
crisis intervention — creating one of the best places in
California for seniors to reside.
