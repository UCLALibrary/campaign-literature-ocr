MARIJUANA SMOKING AND CANCER

Although there is very little direct evidence that marijuana smoking can cause
cancer, especially lung cancer, there are indications that the smoking of marijuana
may be more carcinogenic than smoking tobacco. Marijuana cigarettes contain
more tar than tobacco cigarettes. They are also smoked differently - inhaled very
deeply, the smoke held for a long time in the lungs, and smoked to the end, where
tar concentrations are highest. Carcinogenic substances have been found In the
gas phase and smoke condensate of mafijuana, and in addition, marijuana may be
contaminated by fungl, pesticides, and other additives which can't be regulated
because of its illegal status. Most marijuana smokers smoke many fewer cigarettes
than tobacco smokers. Case reports have suggested marijuana as a possible cause
of head and neck cancers in young people. :
