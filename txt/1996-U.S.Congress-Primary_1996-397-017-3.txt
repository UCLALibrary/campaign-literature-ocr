ur community can help stop Newt Gingrich once and for all. If
we can elect a Democrat to Congress in November, we can help
end Newt’s control of the House of Representatives.

But if we are going to win in November, we must vote for the
best Democrat on March 26th.

Both Democratic candidates are similar on the issues: they’re
100% Pro-Choice, support gun control and will work to protect
Medicare, Social Security, education and jobs.

So before you vote, compare the Democratic candidates and ask
yourself: “Who has what it takes to defeat Newt’s Republican
candidate in November?”
