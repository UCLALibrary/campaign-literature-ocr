Greenlining’s Proposed Ballot Argument (not selected by Secretary of State):
PROTECT WORKING MOTHERS, SENIORS AND STUDENTS
VOTE NO ON PROP. 213

This insurance industry-backed initiative is deliberately tricky. It confuses drunk
drivers and felons, who should be punished, with working mothers, the elderly, and
working students, who make up the majority of uninsured motorists. Auto insurance
alone often costs a fourth of the take-home pay of a teacher’s aide. Working moms with
two children just can’t afford it.

By prohibiting all uninsured drivers from suing for pain and suffering, Prop 213, in
effect, prevents up to seven million working poor from getting medical care when hit bya
reckless driver. The problem is that most lawyers will refuse to represent an auto accident
victim just for medical care. Under Prop. 213, reckless drivers get a free ride as long
as they hit tee mothers, the elderly, and college students who can’t afford high
cost insurance.

The insurance industry doesn’t want the public or its customers to focus on high
auto insurance costs and excessive multi-million dollar executive salaries. The real
problem with the insurance industry is mismanagement and exorbitant costs to consumers.
Consumer's Union estimates that insurance companies enjoyed a 28% profit margin in

California last year.
