SMRR

The entrepreneurial city.

When a SMRR City Council majority was elected in 1981,
there were some who attacked us as a band of radicals who
would drive the city into bankruptcy. Remember the
“People’s Republic of Santa Monica?”

Well today, a SMRR Council presides over a city with a
healthy budget and a vibrant and growing local economy.
Their fiscal prudence has
\ earned Santa Monica
municipal bonds a AAA
rating - the highest rating
of any city in the state.
How did it happen?

Under SMRR leadership,
Santa Monica stopped the
helter-skelter
overdevelopment of our
commercial areas and promoted well-planned,
low-rise pedestrian friendly development. Compare Santa
Monica with the “high-rise ghetto” that begins on Wilshire
Boulevard the minute you cross into Los Angeles.

The creation of the Third Street Promenade is just the most
impressive example. The Promenade, more than simply
being a great place to stroll, dine, see a movie or shop, also
creates enormous revenues for the city — which support the
wide range of community enhancements that make Santa
Monica a wonderful place to live.

The revitalization of the run-down Santa Monica Pier, the soul
of Santa Monica, is another quality project that we can all be
extremely proud of. It has become one of Southern
California's finest family attractions.

SMRR will continue to fight for a human-scale
city and responsible, quality development -
with a greater emphasis on meeting the local
needs of Santa Monica residents.
