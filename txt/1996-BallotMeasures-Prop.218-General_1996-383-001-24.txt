STOP THE HIDDEN HEALTH CARE TAX
The Facts About Propositions 214 and 216

This November, Californians will
vote on dual initiatives placed on
the ballot by two labor organiza-
tions, the Service Employees Inter-
national Union (SEIU) and the Cali-
fornia Nurses Association (CNA).
Propositions 214 and 216 will result
in dramatically increased health
care costs for all Californians, but
will do nothing to improve access
to, or quality of, health care in our
state. The proposals are bad medi-
cine for California consumers, tax-
payers and business.

Here are just a few of the many rea-
sons Californians are saying “NO” to
these ill-conceived and costly measures:

Will Lead To Higher Costs

Propositions 214 and 216
would result in higher taxpayers
costs in the range of
tens of millions to
hundreds of millions
of dollars annually
for increased state
and local govern-
ment expenditures
for health care pro-
grams and benefits.

Proposition 216
would also result in

~ reduced General Fund revenue of up to

tens of millions of dollars annually,
which would have a devastating effect
on funding for education, law enforce-
ment and other critical programs.

Proposition 216 enacts four new
taxes on health care businesses that
will ultimately cost Californians bil-
lions of dollars.

An independent economic study
of both 214 and 216 conducted by the
Barents Group (the economic fore-
casting division of KPMG) predicted
that health insurance premiums could
increase by up to 15%.

The Barents study also found:

¢ The measures would result in near-
ly $3 billion in higher health insur-
ance costs for employers.

¢ Nearly $1 billion in higher costs for
small employers.

¢ Almost $700 million per year in
higher costs for employees.

¢ Higher costs for workers’ compen-
sation coverage.

* Over $8 billion in reduced eco-
nomic activity and up to 60,000
lost jobs by the year 2003 due to
higher health care and workers’
comp costs.

Will Create More Government
Involvement

Proposition 216 would result in
a huge new bureaucracy, the so-
called Health Care “Consumer” As-
sociation. The organization would
not provide affordable coverage for
Its primary purpose
would be to file
lawsuits, issue re-
ports, conduct
studies, advise
other state agen-
cies, and partici-
pate in legal and
administrative
proceedings. Six

would be. political appointees. No
health care knowledge is required.

Both Propositions 214 and 216
require dozens of new rules, regula-
tions and government functions,
employing a legion of government
bureaucrats.

The initiatives give government
the power to review every decision
made by a health care pro-vider. For
example, the staffing levels of every
hospital, nursing home, clinic and
doctor’s office would be subject to re-
view. That’s too much government
involvement.

The measures will lead to a huge
increase in lawsuits because virtually
every decision made by a health plan
or health facility could end up in
court. The fees of lawyers filing
those lawsuits could often be paid by
the group being sued, raising con-
sumer costs even more.

Will Make Things Worse

Propositions 214 and 216 are
advertised as consumer “protection”
acts, but in reality are not consumer-
friendly. Consumers want quality
health care coverage they can get,
keep and afford. These initiatives will
not ensure quality, and higher costs
caused by 214 and 216 will make
access to care more difficult.

These measures will add to the
ranks of the uninsured. Health care
reform should make coverage more
affordable; Propositions 214 and 216
will make coverage more expensive.
Higher costs will lead to fewer people
being able to afford coverage.

Propositions 214 and 216 will
hurt public hospitals that provide care
to the indigent and poor. These mea-
sures do not exempt public hospitals
from the reckless cost-increasing
mandates of their provisions. Public
health facilities — already struggling
to provide urgently needed care to
poor and indigent citizens — will
have a much harder time making ends
meet under these initiatives. Some
may not be able to continue at all.

Under Proposition 216, health
facilities would be fined for jo joining...
forces _ becoming part of a health
care network. Struggling health facil-
ities in rural parts of California would
effectively be stopped from aligning
with larger facilities which helps
them to take advantage of new tech-
nologies and equipment.

“Solves” Non-Existent Problems

Both measures purport to solve
non-existent problems, such as ensur-
ing that doctors are not prevented from
advocating for their patients and that
nurses are not prohibited from giving
needed health care information to
patients. Professional standards and
ethics, as well as long-standing
California and federal law, have for
years ensured that caregivers are
encouraged, even required, to advocate
for patients. Further, Governor Wilson
recently signed SB 1847 into law,
strengthening patient advocacy laws.

RIGHT TO VOTE, from page 1

TAXPAYERS HAVE NO RIGHT
TO VOTE ON THESE INCREASES
AND OTHERS LIKE THEM UNLESS
PROPOSITION 218 PASSES!

Proposition 218 will significantly
tighten the kind of benefit assessments
that can be levied.

Here are a few examples of why
fees and assessments and other non-
voted taxes are so unfair:
¢ The poor pay the same assessments

as the rich. An elderly widow pays
exactly the same on her modest

home as a tycoon with a mansion.
There are now over 5,000 local dis-
tricts which can impose fees and
assessments without the consent of
local voters. Special Districts have
increased assessments by over
2400% over 15 years. Likewise,
cities have increased utility taxes
415% and raised benefit assess-
ments 976% — a ten-fold increase.

Non-voted taxes on electricity,
gas, water, and telephone services hit
renters and homeowners hard.

And, retired homeowners get

hit doubly hard!

To confirm the impact of fees and
assessments on you, look at your prop-
erty tax bill. You will see a growing
list of assessments imposed without
voter approval. The list will grow even
larger unless Proposition 218 passes.

Proposition 218 will allow you
and your neighbors — not politicians
— to decide how high your taxes will
be. It will allow those who pay assess-
ments to decide if what they are being
asked to pay for is worth the cost.

Sponsored By Special Interests

Propositions 214 and 216
amount to little more than “employ-
ment protection acts” for California
labor interests. The proposals call
for new staffing quotas to be devel-
oped by state agencies, yet rigorous
staffing criteria have been set and
enforced in California for years.
This exposes the initiatives for what
they really are: an effort to increase
union membership.

Under Proposition 214, pro-
viders, (including physicians, nurses,
and others) could only be discharged
for “just cause,” including malprac-
tice, professional or sexual miscon-
duct, among others. This would
mean that every employment deci-
sion would be subject to government
review or court action. Can you
imagine the government telling you
that you could not discharge an em-
ployee, even if that employee had
virtually nothing to do?

Among the special interests
served by these measures are the
trial lawyers, who will reap obvious
benefits from every employment or
patient care case that goes to court

_ and who also will benefit by inter-

vening in administrative and court
hearings.

Can’t Be Fixed

If these initiatives pass, they
effectively can’t be changed without
another statewide vote when the
inevitable problems develop. Both
measures require that any legislative
changes be limited to those that “fur-
ther the purpose” of the initiatives —
a concept that is undefined in the
measures. Proposition 216 goes so
far as to require a two-thirds vote of
the legislature even to change any
technical aspect of it — a proportion
that will effectively tie the hands of
lawmakers in responding to public
concerns about California’s health
care system.
