Consumers Raise Questions About Medi-Cal Managed Care

Los Angeles consumers hold accountability session with John Rodriquez, Director of Medi-Cal

On March 6, over 120 disgruntled consumers and safety net providers met with John Rodriquez, the Wilson appointee in charge
of the State’s Medi-Cal program. They launched serious questions at him on the viability of the safety net local initiative HMOs which
are required as part of the “two-plan model” for moving AFDC Medi-Cal beneficiaries into managed care. They gave Mr. Rodriquez a
list of sixteen assurances which they want him to make to consumers. The next meeting with Mr. Rodriquez is tentatively scheduled
for April 19, and Richard Chambers from the Health Care Finance Administration is also invited.

he Los Angeles County budget crisis that hit the

national news during the Summer of 1995 has been
brewing for several years. It has its roots in fundamental
problems in the public health service system in California
and other states. The Los Angeles Department of Health
Services (LADHS) continues to rely upon in-patient fee-
for-service funding based on Medi-Cal and the
“disproportionate share” hospital funding scheme. While
the L.A. health care crisis could not be fully solved
without a statewide universal coverage plan and expansion
of health insurance access for working families, the
situation could be improved with community oriented
primary care, cost-efficient managed care, and a less
centralized decision-making structure.

In my former role as LADHS Medical Director, ‘I
recommended in 1991-1992 the adoption of a
decentralized, regional structure whose emphasis was
upon providing quality of care, rather than cost savings
and central control. I urged the development of an
information system that would identify individual
patients, their care, sources of care and clinical outcomes.
I urged the adaption of quality management and
continuous improvement programs throughout the
delivery network. I recommended expanding the
enrollment in the LADHS Medi-Cal Health Maintenance
Organization (HMO), the “Community Health Plan,”
from 12,000 individuals to 300,000 eligibles in the shortest
possible time.

Expanding HMO enrollment would have required a
shift from in-patient, specialty care to primary care in
community settings —- and a similar shift in medical
training programs.

These recommendations were not adopted. In 1996,
LADHS remains centralized in its management style, and
its budget resolution still relies primarily on the
“disproportionate share” funding scheme. (This scheme

. retrieves Federal money for local hospitals and clinics.)

Patients are still not tracked in the complex system.
Primary care, preventive services and enrollment in the
Community Health Plan have actually decreased. The
LADHS budget climbed from $1.8 billion in 1990 to $2.65
billion in the current 1996 budget year, in spite of hospital
discharges dropping from 192,000 in 1992 to 147,000 in
1995, and total bed-days declining from 1.1 million to
$47,000 in the same period.

The alleged $650 million overrun triggered the budget
crisis in May, June and July of 1995. The Board of
Supervisors rejected plans to close the 1500 bed Los

The Los Angeles County Health Care Crisis
by Jonathon B. Weisbuch, MD, MPH (former LADHS Medical Director)

Angeles County (USC) Medical Center flagship. LADHS

Director Robert Gates admitted that his department had

no plan to solve the crisis. The Supervisors appointed Burt

Margolin, a former state legislator and health expert, as

“Health Crisis Czar” to prevent insolvency. In August,

the Board approved Margolin’s recommendations to close

most ambulatory care services, preserving hospitals, and
trying to get Federal money to return the system to full
function. :

By the end of August, Margolin’s plans to close all but
ten public heath centers and six comprehensive health
centers, reduce out-patient care in hospital clinics by 75%,
and lay off 5000 LADHS employees was adopted by the
Board to be implemented by October 1. With the promise
of $365 million from President Clinton to pay for
ambulatory care under Medi-Cal, the closure plan was
modified, and the staff reduction was reduced to 2500. To
date, however, several LADHS health centers have been
contracted out to private managed care providers, but
little else has been done to restructure LADHS and
reorganize the delivery system.

Gates retired effective November 1, 1995. The Board
selected Mark Finucane, the Contra Costa County Health
Director to replace Gates. Upon assuming the
Directorship of LADHS in January 1996, Finucane finds
most LADHS problems still unresolved:

# the budget process is a shambles;

unit costs for services are unknown;

# necessary and unnecessary programs are not
delineated;

# quality problems plague several facilities;

¢ personnel entangelments from the massive layoff will

take months to resolve;

public health, prevention and personal health services

still néed to be integrated;

4 there is no strategic plan to move from fee-for-service
in-patient care toward community oriented primary
care; and

# managed care capitation has few supporters.

These problems are not unique to Los Angeles — they
exist because this nation continues to reject a universal and
uniform method for providing health care to all US
residents. Administrators and policy makers persist in
short term fixes, patches, cost-shifting, and short-changing
those with health care needs and limited political voice.
The situation will likely get worse before it gets better.
What happened in Los Angeles in the Summer of 1995
will take place throughout the land in the coming years.
