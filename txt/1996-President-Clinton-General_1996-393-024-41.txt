The Dole Tax-Cut Plan

@ The Dole tax-cut plan is similar to the Reagan tax
cuts of the 1980s which benefited mostly the wealthiest
Americans and sent the budget deficit soaring. The main
component of the plan (a 15% cut in income taxes) and
a $500 per-child tax credit together will increase the
federal deficit by at least $481 billion — unless Dole
makes up for the tax cut with spending cuts. Dole is not
saying which programs he would cut to pay for the tax
cut. Conservative economist Robert Samuelson says the
economic projections on which Dole based his tax-cut
plan are “mostly a pipe dream.”

(The Washington Post, 8-8-96; 8-12-96)

@ The Dole record has been mixed on the tax issue. In
1978, Dole voted for a bill providing tax relief to people
earning less than $50,000. In 1989, he worked to ex-
pand the Earned Income Tax Credit which signifi-
cantly reduces the tax burden for low- and middle-income
wage eamers. Unfortunately, Dole has changed posi-
tions, voting in 1995 to curb the Earned Income Tax
Credit while also voting to give a $19 billion tax cut to
the wealthiest 5% of Americans.

The Minimum Wage
@ Earlier this year, the Associated Press reported that
Dole was using his power as Senate Majority Leader “to
block Democratic demands for an immediate vote‘on
raising the minimum wage.” President Clinton called on
him to support a 90-cent raise in the minimum wage, but
Dole resisted, withholding support for the bill until May
24 — the day after the House approved it. The Senate
didn’t approve the minimum-wage increase until July 9,
nearly amonth after Dole resigned from the Senate.
(Associated Press, 3/26/96; Washington Times, 7/10/96)

@ Dole hasan extensive record of opposition to raising
the minimum wage. He voted nine times against increas-
ing the minimum wage: 1961, 1966, 1972, 1973, 1987,
1988, 1993, 1995 and 1996. As both a congressman and
asenator, Dole voted to raise his own pay seven times.
Over that 35-year period, Dole’s pay rose 50% more than
the minimum wage.

The Dole Record

Safe Neighborhoods

= Congress approved President Clinton’s Crime Bill,
which included a ban on 17 types ofassault weapons.
Ina letter to a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association
(NRA), Dole said that repealing the ban on assault
weapons will be “one of my legislative priorities.” On
July 9 of this year, Dole appeared to shift positions,
saying: ““We’ve moved beyond the debate over banning
assault weapons.” The NRA says it believes Dole
remains committed to repealing the ban.

(Letter to NRA lobbyist Tanya Metaksa, 3/10/95;
Washington Times, 7/10/96)

Family & Medical Leave

@ Between 1991 and 1993, Bob Dole voted against
the Family and Medical Leave Act on three separate
occasions, calling the measure too costly for business.
When a bill to allow up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave was
proposed in 1988, Dole led the filibuster that effectively
killed the bill.

(Congressional Record, 1991-93; AFL-CIO Report on Congress, 1988)

Workplace Fairness

@ In 1992, Dole voted against a bill that would have

prevented companies from permanently replacing

employees who exercise their legal right to strike.
(Congressional Record, cloture vote on the Workplace Fairness Act, 1992)

allowing employers to divertemployee pension funds
for other purposes.

safety officials the right to levy higher penalties for willful
health and safety violations by an employer that lead to
