CONCLUSION

More growth, more opportunity, higher wages, less government, lower taxes. Bob Dole's
Pro-Growth Plan is the right plan for restoring the American Dream.

Each of Bob Doles initiatives will help fuel the economic growth and Opportunity that
are our birthright as a people. Each of these initiatives draws on the simple proposition that the
American people, not government, are the true guardians of our freedom and prosperity. This is
the vision that inspired our Founding Fathers when they declared, with proud courage, that ail
men “are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, thar among these are Life,
Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” We must believe in the power of freedom. We must
believe in ourselves. We must once again seize the opportunities before us as America enters the
21st cencury.
