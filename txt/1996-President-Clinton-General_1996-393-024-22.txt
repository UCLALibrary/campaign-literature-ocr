Lessons for Life campaign -- instilling high standards of conduct and academic achievement in
public schools. Our aim is to work with school administrators throughout the country to develop
tough, fair and consistently enforced discipline codes as well as to develop academic standards that
challenge all students to do their best. In every school district that has raised standards of conduct
and achievement, student performance has improved.

President Clinton has endorsed this campaign and so has Colin Powell. The junior Republican
senator from Kansas, Nancy Kassenbaum (who chairs the Senate Education Committee) has
endorsed the campaign -- and so have hundreds of other members of Congress, governors and other
public officials, parents, civic and religious leaders.

But so far, Bob Dole has failed to endorse this effort.

Why? Because some of Bob Dole's biggest supporters oppose efforts to set higher academic
standards in schools. Ralph Reed and his extremist supporters are on record as opposing Goals
2000 and other attempts to set higher standards at the state and local levels. They look forward to
the day when private and religious schools can count on receiving government subsidies. These
Dole supporters do not want to have to meet any prescribed academic standards in order to be
eligible for their government handouts. Reed and others view vouchers as an opportunity to siphon
millions of taxpayer dollars to fund their own private agendas.

When it comes to education, the real debate in this election should be about how we can
improve public schools -- not on how we should abandon them as Bob Dole would have us do. His
plan would end our nation's commitment to universal access to a high-quality, free public
education. Is this really the path Americans want to take?
