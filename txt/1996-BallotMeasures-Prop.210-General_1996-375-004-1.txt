PROPOSITION 210, LIVING WAGE ACT OF 1996

Section 1. The people of California find and declare that:

Because of inflation, Californians who earn the minimum wage can buy less today
than at any time in the past 40 years;

At $4.25 per hour, the current minimum wage punishes hard work. It is so low
that minimum wage workers often make less than people on welfare;

Increasing the minimum wage will reward work by making it pay more than
welfare;

Because good paying jobs are becoming so hard to find, it is more important than
ever that California has a living minimum wage;

The purpose of the Living Wage Act of 1996 is to restore the purchasing power of
the minimum wage and to help minimum wage workers lift themselves out of poverty;

To achieve that purpose, the Living Wage Act of 1996 will increase the minimum
wage to $5.00 per hour in 1997 and $5.75 per hour in 1998.

Section 2. Section 1182.11 is added to the Labor Code to read:

Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, on and after March 1, 1997, the
minimum wage for all industries shall not be less than five dollars ($5.00) per hour; on
and after March 1, 1998, the minimum wage for all industries shall not be less than five
dollars and seventy-five cents ($5.75) per hour. The Industrial Welfare Commission
shall, at a public meeting, adopt minimum wage orders consistent with this Section
without convening wage boards, which wage orders shall be final and conclusive for all
purposes.

Section 3. Name of Act.
This statute shall be known as the Living Wage Act of 1996.
Section 4. Severability.
It is the intent of the People that the provisions of this act are severable and that
if any provision of this act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is

held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision or application of this act
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.
