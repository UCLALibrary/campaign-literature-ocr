QUESTION:

ANSWER:

No. As written, the initiative says that if more than ten percent of the spaces in
a mobilehome park are covered by a rent control ordinance, the parkowner
does not have to offer the rental assistance at all.

If the initiative is passed and becomes law in California, how could it be
amended in the future?

This parkowner-sponsored initiative, if it becomes law, could only be amended
in the future by a two-thirds vote of the legislature and the approval of the
Governor. Therefore, passage of any amendments to the initiative would be
extremely difficult to obtain.

What can I do to defeat the "Mobilehome Rent Assistance, Mobilehome Rent
Control Restrictions Initiative"?

Read this question and answer flyer at your next GSMOL Chapter meeting and
at all district and zone meetings. Make sure that a copy of this questionnaire is
presented to each member of your city council and each supervisor in your
county. Ask that your city council and board of supervisors adopt a resolution
opposing the "Mobilehome Rent Assistance, Mobilehome Rent Control
Restrictions Initiative", because it will reduce the authority of your local
government to address local problems. Take a copy of this question and
answer draft to your local newspaper and radio stations and request that they
adopt a policy opposing this misleading initiative.
