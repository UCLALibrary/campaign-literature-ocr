Mayor Paul Rosenstein has
been a tenants’ rights activist
and a member of Santa
Monicans for Renters’ Rights (SMRR) for more than a dozen years.

In 1992, Paul was elected to the City Council on the SMRR slate.
As part of the SMRR majority, Paul has fought for tenants’ rights,
including protecting Santa Monica tenants from harassment and

eviction® under the new statewide ‘‘vacancy decontrol’’ law.

That’s why Paul Rosenstein is supported by leading rent control
advocates like Rent Board Members Dolores Press and Robert
Niemann, Council Member Judy Abdo, former Santa Monica
Mayor Denny Zane, former SMRR Co-Chair Brad Jones, former
Rent Board Member Leslie Lambert and many leaders and
members of Santa Monicans for Renters Rights (SMRR).
