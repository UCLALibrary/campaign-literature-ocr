FOR PRESIDENT

The National Federation of Independent Business
Washington, D.C.
October 23, 1995

Thank you all very much.

It’s great to be here with so many leaders of the small business
community.

This is Washington, after all, and I want you to feel right at
home, so please applaud in triplicate, and if you need to go to the
washroom, please file an environmental impact statement.

As you know, I've been doing a lot of traveling lately -- I guess
it’s part of the new job description.

Actually, now that the campaign season is underway, I have
something in common with President Clinton. We both visit
Washington from time to time.

Everywhere I go in this campaign I’ve been talking about the
“culture of Washington,” and everyone I speak with knows exactly
what I mean: arrogance, insularity, the “ government-knows-best”
mentality. The fact is that the more things change here, the more they
stay exactly the same -- government is still too big and taxes too high.

It’s as if Washington were a giant glacier, steadily advancing on
the nation, covering more and more of the economy, of our private
lives; and all the rhetoric of the Washington pols are only the swirls
of mist above the ice. All the promises of change, all the proud

declarations, are only so many phantoms and illusions, because
