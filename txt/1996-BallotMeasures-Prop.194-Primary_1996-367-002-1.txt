EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

It is yell known that ex-offenders have a difficult time acjusting to
life outside of prison walls. High recidivism rates are alone sufficient
testimony to the engoing temptations of crime, but there is also ample docu-
mentation that the balance of incentives is often heavily against law abiding
pehavior; In particular, the vast majority of ex-offenders are released with
little pocket money, virtually no savings, and poor job prospects. It is no
surprise, therefore, that large numbers commit new offenses directly as a
result of economic need or indirectly as a result of the frustrations that
Tien hardships can produce.

. California Senate Bill 224," sponsored by Senator Peter Behr, was written
in part to address such difficulties. In brief, Senate Bill 224 extends eli-
gibility For unemployment benefits to ex-offenders upon release from prison.

The apie eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits excluces most ex-
offenders de facto because eligibility is determines by employsent in an
_ earlier "base period” that, for individuals serving “prison terns « represents
time behind bars. Under the legislation, however, prisoners can use prison.
jobs and/or vocational training programs in prison to qualify for unemp loy~
ment compensation; prisoners who earn the equivalent of $1500 are able to
apply for unemp?oyment benefits upon release , if they cannot find work. Weekly
benefits, after the threshold is exceeded, are determined in the usual
manner through highest quarterly earnings during the base period.

While California Senate Bill 224 could be justified in a variety of
ways, the legislation mandated an evaluation of the Bill's imgect. Of
particular interest was whether individuals who received the benefits were
less likely to seturn to prison compared to individuals who did not receive

_the benefits. In the pages that follow we report the results of that evalua-

eiar
