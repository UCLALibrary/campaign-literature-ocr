A comprehensive environmental program.

No other California city has done more to protect the
environment, and our health, than Santa Monica. SMRR-
supported City Councilmembers have adopted a
comprehensive environmental program including:

¢ Cleaning up the Santa Monica Bay by reducing
sewage and urban runoff

¢ Using and promoting alternative fuels and electric
vehicles

¢ Creating model recycling and waste reduction
programs that are now used throughout the state

¢ Reducing emissions of ozone-depleting gasses in
Santa Monica

© Developing aggressive water conservation
programs

SMRR is committed to the
conversion of the Santa
Monica Municipal Bus
system to clean alternative
fuels, and the creation of
economical local shuttles
to serve our
neighborhoods,
commercial areas, parks
and beaches.

SMRR believes we have a responsibility to leave our
community, and our world, better off than we found it. They
will work to make the “Sustainable City”

program a guiding principle for all city

actions and policies.
