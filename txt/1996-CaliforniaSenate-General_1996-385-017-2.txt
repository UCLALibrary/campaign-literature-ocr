Dear Friend,

The escalation of juvenile crime is of great concern to Glendale residents. It is crucial
that we elect leaders who are tough on crime and who will work to prevent our youth
from becoming involved in criminal activity.

Adam Schiff is a sensible moderate who will work for bipartisan solutions to community
problems. A Former Federal Criminal Prosecutor with a 100% conviction record, Adam
will continue to battle crime by reforming California’s failing juvenile justice system.

Because 4 good education is the best crime prevention, Adam will work to improve the
quality of our public schools by cutting bureaucracy and making sure our schools
receive adequate funding from state government.

In addition to education, Adam’s top priority is public safety and he will work for full
funding for essential services like police, fire and paramedics. By protecting and
providing for these vital areas, Glendale will continue to be the safe community that it
has always been.

Unlike his opponent, Adam has been a resident of our area for years. He is active in
community service, volunteers at his local high school and in the Big Brother program,
and serves as an adjunct Professor at a local Community College-

On November 5th, join us in electing Adam Schiff as Glendale’s next State Senator.
Sincerely,

Jack Morrison, President Sandi Steinberg, President

Glendale Firefighters Association Glendale Teachers Association

ps. Adam Schiff is also endorsed by Glendale School Board member Lynda Rocamora
and Glendale Community College Trustee Robert Holmes.
