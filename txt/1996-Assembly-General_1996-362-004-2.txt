Adam Schiff and Scott Wildman —
well rewarded by the personal injury trial lawyers

Schiff took $173,867
Wildman raked in $21,244

Frivolous lawsuits ... they cost all of us
in the form of higher taxes, higher prices
and increased court costs.

Last year alone, California’s 118,000
lawyers filed over one million new civil
lawsuits. It just keeps getting worse ...
and the only ones benefiting are the per-
sonal injury trial lawyers.

Why do the ambulance chasing personal
injury trial lawyers contribute so much
money to lawyer Senate candidate Adam

Schiff and Assembly candidate Scott
Wildman? Because they can count on
them to vote against lawsuit reform legisla-
tion that could save all of us — taxpayers,
consumers and business owners — millions
of dollars.

Personal injury trial lawyers don’t
want lawsuit reform. It would hit them
where it hurts — in the pocketbook.
So they keep opening wallets to Schiff
and Wildman — and we all end up

paying for it.

Trial Lawyer Contributions So Far:
Adam Schiff $173,867...and counting

Scott Wildman $21,244...and counting

Paula Boland and John Geranios will fight against lawsuit abuse.
They'll work for us — not the personal injury trial lawyers.
