Argument Against Proposition 213

SAY “NO” TO NO-FAULT FOR RECKLESS DRIVERS. . .
VOTE “NO” ON PROPOSITION 213

In March, % of California’s voters said “NO” to Proposition
200—No-Fault auto insurance. We don’t want a law that allows
reckless drivers to avoid responsibility for their actions.

But ropoinon 213 says that if a reckless driver who can afford
insurance hits an innocent person who cannot . . . the reckless driver
gets off without paying for all the injuries and damage they've done.

That’s wrong.

The high cost of insurance makes it impossible for many poor and
wapking people to buy insurance. If insurance companies won't sell
affordable insurance, it is completely unfair to deny people full
compensation for a car accident that is not even their fault.

YOU CAN SAY “NO” TO FELONS AND STILL . . .
VOTE “NO” ON PROPOSITION 213

Courts won't allow convicted felons to get damages for injuries they
cause. So why are “felons” included in the title of Proposition 213?

The insurance companies pushing No-Fault want to divert your
pigenuon from their real agenda: boosting their profits to excessive
levels.

Insurance companies make money anytime a reckless driver they
insure is not held at fault.

The insurance companies couldn’t get us to swallow No-Fault in one
big gulp, so they’re trying to feed it to us in little bites.

YOU CAN SAY “NO” TO DRUNK DRIVERS AND STILL . . .
VOTE “NO” ON PROPOSITION 213

California laws already say drunk drivers can’t recover damages if
they cause an accident. So why are they included in the title of
Proposition 213?

The insurance companies have failed twice to get No-Fault insurance
started in California. In Proposition 213 they are hiding the No-Fault
idea behind wild talk about felons and drunk drivers.

NO MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE .. .
VOTE “NO” ON PROPOSITION 213

The No-Faulters argue that Proposition 213 will save Californians
$323 million per year.

We've heard that line before.

There is nothing in Proposition 213 that says Californians will see
their insurance rates go down. In No-Fault states, auto insurance
premiums have increased an average of 40% in recent years.

No insurance rate reductions. No savings for consumers. The only
people who benefit from this No-Fault scheme are reckless
drivers . . . and the insurance companies who paid to put it on the
ballot.

Insurance companies win, you lose.

SAY “NO” TO RECKLESS DRIVER NO-FAULT . . .
VOTE “NO” ON PROPOSITION 213.
