Scott Wildman is misleading voters about what he’s
done—and what he'll do in the State Assembly.

Scott Wildman claims he is a businessman. But there’s no record of his
owning a business anywhere in Los Angeles County—or anywhere else
in California. (Source: Scott Wildman Literature, Official Records from Los Angeles County
Recorder and California Secretary of State)

He calls himself a “teacher”—but he’s really a union employee with
UTLA, the same union that opposed Proposition 187.

He says he'll fight for taxpayers—but county records show he had a tax
lien placed against him for failing to pay his property taxes. (Source: Alameda
County Tax Records, 2-1-90)

He told voters he backed Proposition 187 to fight illegal immigration but
later admitted he voted against it. (Source: Glendale News Press, 8-22-96 and Glendale
Community Coordinating Council Forum, 9-25-96)

He calls himself a long-time resident, but he still takes the tax exemption

on his home in the San Francisco Bay Area.

He says he'll fight crime, but is supported by San Francisco politicians
Carol Migden and John Burton—chief opponents of the death penalty

and California’s “Three Strikes” law. (Source: Scott Wildman Financial Records and
Assembly Vote Records)

If we can’t trust Scott Wildman to tell the truth
now—how can we trust him in the State Assembly.
