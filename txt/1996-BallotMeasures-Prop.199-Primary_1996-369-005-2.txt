v Prop. 199 gives power to Sacramento politicians and takes it
away from local voters. Prop. 199 wipes out over 80 local initiatives and laws --
laws passed by voters and local officials. Prop. 199 prohibits local voters from ever passing

another mobilehome rent protection law. It gives the State Legislature all power over

mobilehome rents. Don't give more power to Sacramento politicians!
