NOTES

1. The U.S. spends over $270 billion per year
on public and elementary education, and expen-
ditures per pupil, adjusted for inflation, have
increased more than 25% over the past ten years.
Yet America is falling behind in the knowledge
race. Recent National Educational Goals Panel
statistics (see U.S News and World Report, April
1, 1996) included the following:

¢ Among U.S. high school seniors, 60% could
not meet suggested national educational stan-
dards; 76% spend less than five hours per
week on homework, compared with 35% of
seniors in Japan

¢ U.S. high school students spend less than half
as much class time studying math, history
and science as do students in Japan, France,
and Germany

° Only 4.4% of U.S. students pass advanced
placement exams, compared to 33% in
France, Germany , Israel, and Japan

¢ Acomparison of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Is-
rael, Scotland, Canada, and the U.S. found
that the U.S. has the shortest school year—
62 days shorter than Japan's

2. A1994 survey found that at least one third of
all school children have used an illicit drug other
than marijuana or alcohol before graduation from
high school. Furthermore, it is estimated that
one out of four American high school students
has a serious drinking problem.

3. According to the National Center for Juve-
nile Justice, murder arrests among 10- to 17-
year-olds have doubled since 1983, and the ac-
tual murder rate among 14- to 17-year-olds has
risen 165% since 1984. Crimes in and around
American public schools have increased signifi-
cantly; well over 100,000 students now carry a
gun to school. Arecent U.S. Justice Department
found that juvenile arrests for gun charges have
doubled since 1985, and gunshot wounds have

become the second leading cause of death among
high school students.

4. Developmental psychologists have outlined
specific, natural stages of psychological growth
in children. The final stage, termed “formal op-
erations” by Piaget, is associated with adoles-
cence and represents the level of mental func-
tioning in which abstract thinking becomes sta-
bilized. Due to the inadequacies of our educa-
tional system, the majority of our students never
achieve this stage of normal adolescent mental
development across cognitive domains—let
alone their full potential. (For a more compre-
hensive treatment of this topic, see Alexander,
Charles N., and Langer, Ellen J. (eds.), Higher
Stages of Human Development: Perspectives on
Adult Growth, New York: Oxford, 1990.)

5. A series of recent studies has found a corre-
lation between nutrition and academic perfor-
mance (Personality and Individual Differences
4:343 & 361, 1991). These studies found that in
several hundred schools in New York, there was
a 16% gain in academic performance resulting
from improved nutrition. The study suggested
that many students experience malnutrition, too
slight for clinical signs, but which nevertheless
affected their intelligence and academic perfor-
mance. This impairment can be corrected
through improved nutrition.

6. These prevention-oriented health care pro-
grams include Maharishi Ayur- Veda—a natural
system of health care that promotes balance in
mind, body, and behavior and that has been
shown to significantly reduce medical utiliza-
tion by producing better health in its practition-
ers. These programs strengthen mind and body
and reduce anxiety, thereby enhancing receptiv-
ity and the capacity for learning.

7. Research confirms a marked improvement in
student health and a reduction in drug abuse,
alcohol use, and cigarette use through programs

proposed by the Natural Law Party (Alcoholism
Treatment Quarterly 11 (1/2,3/4), 1994; Inter-
national Journal of Addictions 12:729, 1977;
Bulletin on Narcotics 40:50, 1988; Journal of
Addictions 14:147, 1981; 26:293, 1991; Ameri-
can Journal of Psychiatry 131:60, 1974).

8. Inthe U.S., model institutions incorporating
educational programs endorsed by the Natural
Law Party include Maharishi University of Man-
agement in Fairfield, Iowa, and its award-win-
ning laboratory school from preschool to 12th
grade. In addition to a strong traditional aca-
demic program, students at these institutions gain
an integrated vision of all aspects of life through
their study and experience of the laws of nature,
which structure and uphold growth and prdgress
in their own lives and on all levels of the envi-
ronment. Such an approach to education devel-
ops student awareness of and curiosity about the
deeper functioning of nature’s intelligence.

9. Extensive scientific research on one program
endorsed by the Natural Law Party—the Tran-
scendental Meditation program—has consis-
tently demonstrated its capacity to unfold stu-
dent potential and thereby fulfill the highest goals
of education:

For decades, IQ was thought to be static, a meas-
ured quantity that was fixed after a certain age.
» However, research indicates that the practice of
Transcendental Meditation significantly -in-
creases IQ (Educational Technology 19:7, 1979;
Personality and Individual Differences 12:1105,
1991; College Student Journal 15:140, 1981;
Perceptual and Motor Skills 62:731, 1986).

Other scientific studies have shown that prac-
tice of Transcendental Meditation increases
learning ability, improves memory, and enhances
orderliness of brain functioning (Memory and
Cognition 10:205, 1982; International Journal
of Neuroscience 14:147, 1981; Psychosomatic
Medicine 46 (3):267, 1984); reduces stress and
exam anxiety (Journal of Clinical Psychology
45:957, 1989); stimulates ego development,
motivation, and moral reasoning (Journal of
Social Behavior and Personality 6:189, 1991;

~ Journal of Moral Education 12:166, 1983); and

results in significant improvements in analytic
intelligence, self-concept, and general school
performance among inner-city youths (“Effects
of the Transcendental Meditation Program with
Low-Income Inner-City Children,” presented at
the 98th Annual Convention of the American
Psychological Association, Boston, Massachu-
setts, August 1990).
