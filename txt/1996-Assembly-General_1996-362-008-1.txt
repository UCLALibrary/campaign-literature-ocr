We urgently need to restore trust in government. That's why we're
endorsing John Geranios for State Assembly and opposing Scott Wildman.

Scott Wildman said he supported Proposition 187 to fight illegal
immigration, but later admitted he voted against it.

Wildman claims to be tough on crime. But he wants to weaken
California's "3 Strikes" law and says "enforcement of our laws won't
solve our basic problems." We disagree.

Wildman tells you he's a businessman. But there's no record of him
owning a business anywhere in California. He claims to be a teacher.
But he's really a union activist.

Scott Wildman calls himself a tax reformer. But county records
show he had a tax lien placed against him for failing to pay his property
taxes. You get the picture.

John Geranios is a welcome change from politicians who'll tell
you anything to win. John is a local businessman and award-winning
college instructor who heads the Business Department at Mount St. Mary's
College.

John Geranios offers solid ideas for fighting gangs, illegal
immigration, crime and welfare abuse. He has a detailed plan for
restoring educational excellence, cutting government waste and
revitalizing our economy. And he has the experience and good sense
to help make it happen.

John Geranios offers substance, not slogans. We're proud to
endorse him for State Assembly.

P.S. John Geranios is the clear choice of law enforcement -- unanimously
supported by police officers in Glendale, Burbank and Los Angeles.
