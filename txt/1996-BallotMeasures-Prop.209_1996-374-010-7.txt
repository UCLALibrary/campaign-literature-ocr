Text of the California Civil Rights Initiative,
a Proposed State Constitutional Amendment

The following section, the “California Civil Rights Act,” is
hereby added to Article I of the California Constitution:

Section 31. [Civil rights.]

(a) Neither the state of California nor any of its political
subdivisions or agents shall use race, sex, color, ethnicity or
national origin as a criterion for either discriminating against,
or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group
in the operation of the state’s system of public employment,
public education or public contracting.

-(b) This section shall apply only to state action taker
after the effective date of this section.

(c) Allowable remedies for violations of this section
shall include normal and customary attorney’s fees.

(d) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
prohibiting classifications based on sex which are reasonably
necessary to the normal operation of the state’s system of
public employment or public education.

(e) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
invalidating any court order or consent decree which is in
force as of the effective date of this section.

(f) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
prohibiting state action which is necessary to establish or
maintain eligibility for any federal program, where
ineligibility would result in a loss of federal funds to the state.

(g) If any part or parts of this section are found to be in
conflict with federal law or the United States Constitution, the
section shall be implemented to the maximum extent that
federal law and the United States Constitution permit. Any
provision held invalid shall be severable from the remaining
portions of this section.
