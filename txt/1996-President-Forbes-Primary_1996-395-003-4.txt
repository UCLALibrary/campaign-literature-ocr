There would be no tax on Social Security. No tax on pensions.
No tax on personal savings. For the sake of small businesses and
entrepreneurs, it would zero out capital gains. For Mom-and-Pop
stores, and everyone else, it would eliminate estate taxes.

Let me underline this difference between my proposal and
others: I am straight forwardly calling for a tax cut to expand our
economy and make everyone better off.

Since 1970 -- in just 25 years -- Washington spending has
increased more than seven fold.

During those same years, family income in America has
declined.

But the politicians say “we” can’t afford a tax cut. Maybe we
can’t afford the politicians.

I say it’s time that we cut government's income and raise our _
families’ incomes.

And while we are at it, did you see the news report on
President Clinton, admitting that he raised taxes too much in 1993,
and then blaming it on the Republicans, even though his party
controlled both Houses of Congress at the time? When it comes to
waffling, this man is the International House of Pancakes.

We've been hearing a lot from the President about personal
responsibility lately. And I’m all for that. But wouldn't it be nice if
just once, just one time in his career, this President would honestly
take responsibility for his own actions?

Remember when he flip-flopped on the middle-class tax cut he
promised during the ‘92 campaign, saying that if he cut taxes, the

American people would only “waste the money.”
