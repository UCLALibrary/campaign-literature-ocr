To the Honorable Secretary of State of
California:

We, the undersigned, registered,
qualified voters of California, residents of
County (or City and County),
hereby propose amendments to the California
Civil Code, relating to establishment of a
rental assistance subsidy for qualified poor
and needy mobilehome park tenants,
limitations on mobilehome park rent control in
lieu thereof, and prohibitions of enactment. of
mobilehome rent control measures by the
State and by local charter and general law
cities and counties, and petition the Secretary
of State to submit the same to the voters of
California for their adoption or rejection at
the next succeeding general election. The
proposed statutory amendments (full title and
text of the measure) read as follows:

When costs are incurred which exceed this
amount, it is usually because of a lawsuit brought
by the park owners. If park owners stopped
filing lawsuits, few cities would need to spend a
dime on mobilehome rent control.

This language is merely the formal request of the
voters that the Initiative be adopted. It is called
the “Preamble,” and a similar statement is found .
in any Initiative.. This language is not a part of
the Initiative language, but is purely descnpuve.
