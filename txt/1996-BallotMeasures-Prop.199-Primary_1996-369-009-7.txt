. 15 jurisdictions each had a net cost between $20,000 and $100,000 per year.

. Two jurisdictions each had net costs over $100,000 (in one of those jurisdictions
the net cost was $334,241, in the other the net cost was $228,927.)

. Expense levels were principally determined by whether or not a jurisdiction had
been subjected to iitigation in connection with its program.

. A substantial portion of the jurisdictions which had expenses over $20,000 per
year covered part or all of the cost of the program through annual registration
fees. These fees were assessed on park owners. In most jurisdictions, all or part
or of the fee could be passed through to mobilehome owners on a monthly pro-
rata basis.
