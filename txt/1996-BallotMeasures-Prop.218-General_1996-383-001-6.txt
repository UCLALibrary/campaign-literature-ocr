HOW RENTERS BENEAT UNDER PROPOSITION 218
COMPARED T0 CURRENT LAW

UNDER PROPOSITION 218
(The Right to Vote on Taxes Act)

Cities with their own
governing charter currently
levy many taxes, like utility
user taxes, WITHOUT
VOTER APPROVAL.
About half of all Californians

live in charter cities.

Voter approval is required
for ALL taxes imposed

by ALL local governments.
This covers all new taxes
and tax increases. All
registered voters, including
renters, may vote in tax

elections.

Many local agencies
impose utility fees and
charges that are excessive,
resulting in unnecessarily
high utility bills. Many
renters have been hit hard
by these high fees and

charges.

Strict limitations are placed
on many fees and charges,
including utility fees and
charges for water, sewer,
and refuse collection
services. Renter's will
benefit from the expected
reduction in utility fees and
charges resulting from

these limitations.

Renters generally have
NO RIGHT to protest
an assessment. Only

property owners, including

nonresident property owners,

may legally protest an

assessment.

Any person, INCLUDING
RENTERS, may vote if
they are directly liable to

pay an assessment.

â€˜Taxpayers, including
renters, have very limited
ability to use the initiative
power to reduce or repeal
local taxes, assessments,

fees, or charges.

Provides that taxpayers,
including renters, may
use the initiative power
to reduce or repeal ANY

local tax, assessment, fee,

or charge. Taxpayers will
no longer be at the mercy
of local politicians if
they believe a local tax,
assessment, fee or charge

is cither too high or

unnecessary.
