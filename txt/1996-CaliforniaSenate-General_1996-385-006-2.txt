THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL RIGHTS INITIATIVE

Lawyer
Adam Schiff says

NO!

Rights Initiative — Proposition 209 — to end government sanctioned quotas and
discrimination. (source: Glendale News-Press, 7/22/96)

If Lawyer Schiff has his way, Proposition 209 would fail and quotas, preferences,
and set asides that give special treatment to some and discriminate against others
would continue forever.

Today, job applicants are losing their opportunity to work because their race does
not meet some “goal” or “quota.” Students are losing their opportunity to attend ©
state universities because they are the “wrong” race. Contracts for government work
go to high bidders because of their race.

Adam Schiff doesn’t care who is being hurt. He opposes Proposition 209 because
that’s what the liberal special interests paying for his campaign told him to do.

Adam Schiff says NO to Proposition 209.

Assemblywoman
Paula Boland says

YES!

Assemblywoman Paula Boland strongly supports Propostion 209 to end
government quotas and preferences.

Boland is our local Chairwoman for the California Civil Rights Initiative. She’s
leading the fight to stop unfair government practices that discriminate against anyone
because of their race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.

The daughter of immigrant parents, Paula Boland believes every citizen should be
allowed to compete in our society on a fair and color-blind basis.

Paula Boland knows that official government discrimination costs taxpayers and
consumers at least $343 million every year.

Paula believes it’s time for Californians to come together under a standard of
equal treatment for all that’s fair to every taxpayer, consumer, and citizen.

Paula Boland says YES to Proposition 209.

Let’s say NO to Adam Schiff.

LET’S SAY YES TO PAULA BOLAND.
