Teachers unions could still give over a million dollars in a two year election cycle under the "tough"
CALPIRG limits. This contributor loophole is no simple drafting error. The CALPIRG initiative is
part of a National Public Interest Research Group campaign to pass so-called reform initiatives in
targeted states. In California, CALPIRG made a calculated decision to play favorites with their
political allies. They have carefully polled the popularity of their illegal provisions. And on the
surface, their pie-in-the-sky reforms appear popular.

Consumer Fraud-

The League of Women Voters rarely uses such strong language as "consumer fraud" to describe
public policy alternatives. However, when you consider: 1) the special interest loophole; 2) federal
court cases striking down key provisions of what's in the CALPIRG initiative; 3) and now the repeal
of key provisions of the state's voter-approved Ethics in Government Act of 1990 without telling their
supporters or the voters, we are left with one inevitable conclusion: the "bait and switch" nature of
the initiative represents a serious example of consumer fraud.

Here's the evidence for this strong language:
Mandatory Spending Limits-

Unequivocally and with crystal clarity, the US Supreme Court ruled in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976 that
mandatory spending limits like those in the CALPIRG initiative are illegal. CALPIRG cannot point

â€˜These figures apply the CALPIRG Citizen Contribution
Committee limitations to candidates supported in the 1993-94
election cycle and include actual contribution amounts or the
initiative limits where the actual contributions exceeded the
limits. Totals under the CALPIRG initiative are limited by
either the membership base of the organization ($25 per member
per year) or by the sum of the contribution limits to individual
candidates ($20,000 for legislative candidates; $40,000 for
statewide candidates). For example, where a CTA contribution was
over the CALPIRG limit we calculated the contribution at the
limit. If the contribution was less than the limit it remained
unchanged. The contributions by the California Trial Lawyers
Association are limited because of the size of its membership.
