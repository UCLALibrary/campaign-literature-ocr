Yes On 218!
Right To Vote On Taxes Act

Proposition 218 prohibits property related fees and charges from exceeding the costs of
the service being provided. With the exception of water, sewer and garbage fees, all property

related fee increases and new fees require majority approval of fee payers.

Proposition 218 will stop local governments from playing games with words — calling taxes
P R 8 prying ie}
by other names like “fees”, “assessments”, or “changes” — to circumvent the taxpayers right

to vote established by Proposition 13 and Proposition 62.

By requiring government to seek the consent of the taxed, Proposition 218 will usher in a

new era of cooperation between local officials and citizens.
