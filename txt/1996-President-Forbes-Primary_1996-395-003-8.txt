the Beltway is that virtually nothing is going to change, budget or no
budget. The entire budget game has been played within the twenty-
yard lines. In the end, no one really scored. They didn’t even get
close to the end zone.

But even better for the Democrats, imagine what happens when
the smoke of battle clears and the America people see that no matter
whom they elect to Congress, the results remain the same: taxes are
still high, and the government continues to grow bigger and more
powerful, even as the rest of the country is forced to make do with
less.

“Imagine the disillusionment,” those Democratic consultants
must be saying to themselves with big smiles, “the ‘Republican
Revolution’ of 1994 has gotten bogged down in the Washington
swamp with the rest of us.” And the final pay-off for the Democrats:
if the American people are bitter and disillusioned enough, they
might just re-elect Bill Clinton.

I don’t blame Newt Gingrich. There’s no question that he has
his heart in the right place. And the activist House members know
what this country needs. But even they allowed themselves to be
bound to the ball and chain of the Congressional Budget Office and
the tyranny of “static analysis” -- the first commandment of big
government, which says in effect that whatever you do, you can
never, ever take money away from Washington.

“Static analysis” pretends that tax rates have no effect on
individual behavior. It assumes that if you told workers that on

Monday their wages would be taxed at 100 per cent and on Tuesday
