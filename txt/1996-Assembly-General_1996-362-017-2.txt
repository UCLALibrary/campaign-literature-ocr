Advocate.

He knows what it takes to learn,
because he’s taught in the classroom himself.

This year, parents have the opportunity to
send a real advocate for our kids and schools to
Sacramento - Scott Wildman.

REAL CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE REAL ADVOCATE FOR SCHOOLS PARENT'S & TEACHER'S CHOICE

Scott knows the challenges our
kids face in the classroom because
he's been there himself

¢ He's raised five children and put
them through public schools.

¢ He's a certificated teacher who
knows first-hand what's happening
in the classroom.

¢ He's been a Little League Coach,
parent representative to public
schools, and volunteer tutor.

In the State Assembly, we can count
on Scott to make our children's
education his number one priority,
and more...

¢ Repair and rebuild school facilities

¢ Make schools safe and free from
drugs and violence

¢ Get curriculum back to basics

¢ Provide advanced, challenging

course work in high school to
prepare our children for college.

Scott's dedication to education has
earned him the endorsement

of state and local teachers
associations, school advocates and
parents of Glendale, Burbank and
Los Angeles public school students.

On November 5, join them

in sending the education
advocate our kids need to
Sacramento - vote Scott Wildman
for State Assembly.
