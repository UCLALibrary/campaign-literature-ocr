They also promise funds for libraries,
parks and police. But there’s no account-
ability as to how local governments would
spend the money. Los Angeles County, for
example, spent $694,532 to lobby Sacra-
mento in the first quarter of 1996 — more
than all the other industry, labor and special
interest groups.

BEFORE TAXES ARE RAISED AN-
OTHER DIME, THE BUREAUCRATS
SHOULD TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS,
CUT THE WASTE IN GOVERNMENT
AND ACCOMPLISH MORE WITH THE
$62 BILLION OF OUR TAX DOLLARS
THEY ALREADY HAVE.

State and local government spending per
person in California already is 15 percent
higher than the national average. THE

MORE MONEY TO

POLITICIANS.

PROPOSITION 217 ALSO MESSES
WITH OUR PROPERTY TAXES!

Under current law, property taxes pay for
public services provided by local agencies
where the property is located.

But under Proposition 217, if your city
attracts more new employers or new homes,
it would be penalized by losing its fair share
of property taxes. It could also lead to
higher fees -- for both new home buyers and
new businesses.

Residents of a new city could be subject to
DOUBLE TAXATION. They would
continue to pay property taxes, but none of
these would finance police, fire and other
services for residents of the new city. In-
stead, other local taxes and fees would have
to be found.

TOO MANY PROVISIONS,
UNCERTAIN CONSEQUENCES:

Proposition 217 may be well-intended, but
it contains too many provisions with uncer-
tain and even potentially dangerous eco-
nomic consequences. Proposition 217 is
confusing, tries to tackle too many issues
and would end up hurting small businesses
the most.

TAKES ARE T00 HIGH ALREADY!
VOTE NO ON 217!
