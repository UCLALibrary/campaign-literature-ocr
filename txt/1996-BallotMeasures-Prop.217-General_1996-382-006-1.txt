THE SCHOOL + COMMUNITY INVESTMENT INITIATIVE

A coalition of taxpayers, teachers, firefighters, seniors, law enforcement, tax reform organizations and labor.

BROAD COALITION of California

taxpayers supports Prop. 217. The

School and Community Investment

Initiative will provide approximately $860
million in the first year and $700 million in each following
year for local services such as libraries, fire and police
protection, parks and recreation. Almost half of the
money will go to schools.

Prop. 217 merely continues the same income tax
rates that have been in place for more than 20 years for
the richest 1% of California taxpayers. Prop. 217 also
prevents the state from taking additional local property
tax dollars to balance the state budget in the future.

Who would oppose such an initiative, especially
when school overcrowding, closed libraries and parks and
budget cuts in local services are daily headlines?

The Chamber of Commerce and the National
Federation of Independent Businesses are two
organizations that oppose Prop. 217. The membership
rosters of these organizations boast some of the
wealthiest, most powerful taxpayers in the state.

It is unconscionable for these representatives of
wealthy taxpayers to defend an $860 million tax break
for themselves instead of allowing funds to be directed
to our schools and the local services which are crucial to
a thriving business community.

The ballot argument and other materials authored by
Opponents are riddled with misleading and inaccurate
statements about Prop. 217. A sampling:

“It’s a retroactive tax increase.”

Prop. 217 is not a retroactive tax increase. Prop.
217 will keep in place the top brackets that expire this
year, meaning that when individuals in the top tax
brackets pay personal income taxes in April 1997, they
will pay them at the same rate as taxes paid in April
1996.

In the past, taxpayers have had the opportunity to
vote on taxes. When the temporary sales tax increase
was due to expire, the Governor and Legislature put a
measure on the ballot to make the temporary increase
permanent. The measure was approved by voters in a
