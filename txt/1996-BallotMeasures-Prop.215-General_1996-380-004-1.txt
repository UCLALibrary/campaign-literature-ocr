PROP. 215 -- THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA INITIATIVE

On November 5, 1996, Californians will vote on a ballot initiative,
Proposition 215, that would permit seriously and terminally ill patients to
use marijuana in their medical treatment. If the initiative passes, then pa-
tients, with a doctor’s approval, will be exempt from the state’s criminal
marijuana laws. This initiative will affect thousands of people suffering
from cancer, glaucoma, AIDS and other diseases who do not find ade-
quate relief from legally available medicines.

What Proposition 215 Does

* It protects patients. Today, seriously ill Californians who find marijuana
useful in reducing their pain risk arrest for possessing an illegal drug. Proposi-
tion 215 gives patients a legal defense against marijuana charges, as long as they
have a doctor’s recommendation to use the drug.

* It protects doctors. Under current law, doctors risk professional or legal
sanctions by quietly recommending that patients try marijuana when other
medicines have not worked for them. Proposition 215 would allow doctors to
make that recommendation openly.

* Tt requires a doctor’s approval to use marijuana. Not just anyone can use
marijuana and claim a medical need. To use marijuana legally in their treat-
ment, patients must get their doctor’s approval and be prepared to provide evi-
dence of it.

* Jt protects public safety. Proposition 215 does not change laws banning
marijuana possession or use. Even the patients who are exempted under the ini-
tiative cannot drive, operate heavy machinery, or in any way endanger others
when they are using marijuana.

* It sends a message to Sacramento and Washington, D.C. Through the
Medical Marijuana Initiative, voters have the chance to tell our elected leaders
to find a safe, inexpensive way for patients to get marijuana if they need it.
