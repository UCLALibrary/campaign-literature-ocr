The sky will not fall.

The world will not end. Civilization will not perish.
And big corporations won't get new voting rights with Proposition 218.

Opponents of Proposition 218 are using something called the “big lie.” You've
seen it before—heated rhetoric, boogeymen and dark predictions of doom meant
to strike terror in the hearts of voters.

Opponents of Proposition 218 claim it gives big corporations and foreign
investors frightening new power over little local taxpayers. Scary—but not true.

They say libraries will close, police cars will stop rolling, fires will rampage and
earthquakes will go unanswered if it passes. Do they have no shame?

Proposition 218 simply gives voters the right to vote on new local taxes, assessments and fees.
Nothing scary about that to voters. In fact, in a recent poll, 71% of California
voters said they want the right to vote on new local taxes, assessments and fees.

And why shouldn't they. Local taxes have soared 976% in California since 1978,
many imposed without voter consent.

Because Proposition 218 gives taxpayers more control over the taxes they pay,
it's endorsed by the California Chamber of Commerce, the California Taxpayers
Association, 18 local tax reform groups and 35 legislators.

Don't be suckered by the “big lie.” And remember who's opposing Proposition 218—
the people who keep raising taxes, assessments and fees without voter approval.
