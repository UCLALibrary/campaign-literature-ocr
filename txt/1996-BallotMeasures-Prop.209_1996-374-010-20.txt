Conclusion

If the proposed CCRI were adopted by the electorate, the
constitutionality of the measure and its application to
affirmative action plans would give rise to.a stampede of
litigation. Four constitutional law experts at four
California law schools differ on whether the initiativeâ€™s
ban on preferences for women and minorities would be
found unconstitutional on its face. All four agree,
however, the ban would probably be found
unconstitutional under different factual scenarios
involving past discrimination by governmental entities in
violation of federal constitutional standards.
