Discussion Points

he following discussion is a summary of the points
raised by the four previously identified scholars,
who reviewed the text of the proposed initiative.

Proper Adoption

Initiatives placed on the state ballot by signature-
gathering may amend the California Constitution, but not
revise it (Article XVIII). It’s possible the initiative could
be challenged on the basis that it revises Article IX,
Section 9, addressing the autonomy of the University of
California; or it revises Article XI, Section 5, which grants
“home rule” authority to charter cities to allow them
discretion over employment and other matters potentially
affected by the initiative. This point was raised by
Professors Grodin and Landsberg, but they did not
analyze its aspects in greater detail.

Validity of Proposed Ban on Preferential Treatment
[Section 31 (a)]

The crux of the CCRI constitutionality question lies in its
ban on preferential treatment based on race, sex, color,
ethnicity or national origin. Most. of the scholars who
reviewed the initiative for the California Senate analyzed
whether such a ban would be valid on its face or as
applied to the operations of government agencies and
educational institutions in California.
