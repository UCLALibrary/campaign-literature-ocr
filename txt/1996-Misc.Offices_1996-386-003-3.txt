Dear Democratic Voter.

This mailer is one of the very
few legitimate, non-profit slate
mailers that you will receive in this
election.

The United Westside
Democratic Campaign is a volunteer,
grass roots political action committee
made up of members of the |
Democratic Clubs and members of
the Democratic Party who reside in
our area. The endorsements you see
here are those made by the official
Democratic Party in Los Angeles
County which we support.

By voting for Democrats on
November 5, you are making a
strong statement about a positive
vision for a new American century.

California Democrats will
decide who becomes President and
who controls our Congress and State
Legislature. |

Sincerely,

Susan Locker
Chair, WWDC }

Our headquarters are located
at 2180 Westwood Bivd., Space |
2D, Los Angeles CA 90025 |
