Proposition 217

It is likely that not all school districts would receive new revenue under this
proposition. There are about 50 “basic aid” school districts, that do not receive more
than a constitutional fixed amount of state revenue due to a Supreme Court decision
(in the Serrano case) requiring the state to equalize the spending of school districts.
It should also be noted that local school districts, in the 1996-97 state budget
received $2.5 billion in additional state funds over the amount received from the
1995-96 budget.

* Cities. Counties and Special Districts: These local agencies would receive any
remaining new tax revenues, allocated based on the property tax shift formula.
There are no provisions as to how the money is to be spent.

Although a substantial amount of property tax revenues was shifted from cities,
counties and special districts to schools, they have already backfilled the loss with
other revenue sources. Voters in 1994 approved an added 0.5 percent sales tax
increase to help fill the gap. Local governments have also increased local taxes,
fees and assessments to fill the gap. The most recent report of the State Controller
shows counties with more revenue in 1993-94 after the shift than they had before
the shift. ;
