III. Revenue Sources for Mobilehome Rent Control Programs
a. Annual Registration Fees

Twenty-two of the jurisdictions charge annual registration fees, which are calculated on a per
space basis. In some localities, the fee is adjusted each year to cover the expenses of the pnor
year. In others the fee is set at a level that will cover all expenses except legal expenses. In
conformance ‘with state law,”? registration fees only apply to the spaces that are not under leases
exempted from rent regulation.
