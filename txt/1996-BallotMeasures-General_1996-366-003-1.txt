Dear Miss Aivazian,

West L.A. voters can vote io make their neighborhood parks safer for children
to play and help prevent gangs by voting YES ON PROP. A — The Los
Angeles County Safe Neighborhood Parks Act.

Every local Police Chief in Los Angeles County has made cracking down on
gangs our top priority. We can fight gang violence by cleaning up run-down
parks that are a magnet for graffiti and crime and by providing at-risk youth
with positive recreation alternatives. Prop. A will help keep our young people
out of trouble and make our neighborhoods safer for our seniors and children.

Prop. A will restore parks in every community in Los Angeles County. In West
L.A, Prop. A will:

© Clean Up and Prevent Graffiti in West L.A.

© Help Clean Up Pollution in Santa Monica Bay

Prop. A was developed by citizen groups -- not politicians. Prop. A funds go
directly to badly-needed specific projects. An Annual Independent Audit will
ensure these funds are spent the way you -- the voters -- decide.

Please join us, the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs -- COPS, the
Los Angeles Police Protective League and the Association of Los Angeles
Deputy Sheriffs in voting YES ON A -- Safe Neighborhood Parks for Children
to Play. Together, we can help improve our quality of life and continue our
efforts to keep West L.A. safe.

Please vote YES ON A -- Safe Neighborhood Parks for Children to Play.

President, LA County Police Chiefs’ Association

PS: Prop. A has been endorsed by more than 90 local Police Chiefs, Sheriff's
Captains, and Police Officers Associations.
