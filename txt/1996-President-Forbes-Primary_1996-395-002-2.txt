Renewing Growth, Hope and Opportunity

Dear Fellow Americans:

sn’t it time
to break the
lock-grip
that the
political
class in
Washington has on
$0 much of our lives?
America needs a
new vision, one that
relies on the values

of family, faith and
Steve Forbes freedom. We need
An honest voice. policies that expand

opportunity for all Americans by releasing the
vast growth potential locked inside the
American economy.

That’s why this outsider is running for
President. And that’s why ’'m proposing to
take power away from the Washington
politicians and give it back to the American
people, where it belongs.

START WITH A FLAT TAX
THAT IS A TAX CUT.

An across the board 17% tax rate and expanded
exemptions so that a family of four would pay
no taxes on the first $36,000 of income. With no
taxes on Social Security, pensions, personal sav-
ings or capital gains, this flat tax would be fair
(everyone would pay the same rate), honest (no
more political manipulation of the tax code) and
simple — you could fill it out on a post card.

CUT SPENDING AND
REDUCE GOVERNMENT.

It’s time to remove the dead weight of Washington
and let the American economy run free. Eliminate
the departments of Commerce, Energy, Education,
and HUD. We can also eliminate a whole alphabet
soup of independent agencies.

TERM LIMITS.

Put an end to the permanent political class in
Washington. It’s the will of the people. It makes
sense. Pass term limits now.

BRING BACK 41/2% MORTGAGES.
Take control of our money out of the hands of
politicians. Tie the value of the dollar to a fixed
measure, as we used to, and bring mortgage rates
down to the 4 '/2% our parents took for granted.

RETURN CONTROL OF

SCHOOLS TO PARENTS.
It is time to put America’s parents back in control
of our schools. Give parents the means to educate
their children in the school of their choice. Reduce
the education bureaucracy; put more
resources in the classroom.

REAL SOCIAL SECURITY.

No more Washington-style “reform” of
Social Security, which means raising
taxes and lowering benefits. We must
strengthen security for our elderly —
and make the system sound for the
future — with guaranteed savings in a
growing private sector.

Steve Forbes and his wife Sabina are raising
tive daughters ranging in age from 7 to 22.

President Reagan
appointed Forbes to
lead Radio Free
Europe which
helped bring down
the Iron Curtain.

MEDICAL
SAVINGS
ACCOUNTS.

Put the consumer in charge, with private MSAs
coupled with insurance policies that provide
seamless and complete coverage (no more
Medigaps!). We did a variation of medical savings
accounts at Forbes magazine, and it is very effec-
tive and popular.

AU.S., NOT A U.N.,
FOREIGN POLICY.

Freedom at home depends on strength abroad. As
Chairman of Radio Free Europe and publisher of
Forbes magazine, my work with business leaders
and heads of state has brought me to more than
60 countries. | know from personal experience
that America is still the “last, best hope for
mankind.” We need a Commander in Chief who
recognizes our unique role in the world. One who
conducts a U.S., not a U.N., foreign policy.

| pledge to work tirelessly to make this
vision a reality. Won’t you join me?
