Politician Phil Hawkins:

Burning up your
tax dollars

Incumbents like Phil Hawkins
brag about public service but
engage in self-service.

Tobacco and Big Insurance have a
big investment in Phil Hawkins.
That’s why they want him in the Senate.

Pre special interests like Big

Hawkins has taken $400,000 from special
interests and their middlemen. And he’s

_ repaid them big time at our expense.

Hawkins voted for billions in corporate
welfare including a 19.4% bank and
corporation tax cut that would have cost
schools $600 million.

Hawkins voted for every anti-consumer,
pro-insurance bill to cut competition

and inflate rates. Out of pocket cost for
consumers under these bills is in the billions.

He protected Big Tobacco’s tax deduction for
ads aimed at kids and opposed restrictions
on tobacco billboards near elementary
schools. He didn’t even vote for the ban

on cigarette vending machines where kids
are likely to use them.

Hawkins backers are making out like
bandits at your expense: Assn of Calif
Insurance Companies, Allstate, Farmers,
titute, Philip

Hawkins took your
money too.

$70,000. That’s what he spent this year
on tax-financed, election-time mass
mailings to associate himself with
popular issues.

On September 19, 1992, Hawkins blasted
his opponent for the identical use of mass
mailings. Back then he called it using tax
dollars for political puposes.

Now his values and ethics have taken a
180 degree turn. At your expense.

On November 5,
say NO to Phil Hawkins.
~ The closer
you look,

the worse
he gets.
