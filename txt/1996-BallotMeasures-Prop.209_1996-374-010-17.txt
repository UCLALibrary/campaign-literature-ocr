The Constitutionality of the P J California Civil Rights Initiati

classifications in public employment or public education,
would be unconstitutional if it’s intended to allow sex-
based classifications not allowed under the federal equal
protection clause. The current federal standard requires
“an exceedingly persuasive justification’ that a sex
distinction at least is ‘substantially related to an
important government objective,” notes Professor Varat.

Preferences for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged
Individuals

Senator Lockyer asked the legal experts to comment on
the constitutionality of the proposed initiative if it were
amended to specifically allow preferences for
socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. Professors
Grodin, Landsberg and Varat all agreed adding such a
preference to the proposed initiative would not alter their
constitutional analysis.

Legislative Repeal of State Laws Authorizing
Affirmative Action

The scholars were asked to comment on whether
constitutional issues would be raised if the Legislature
acted to repeal state laws authorizing affirmative action
in public employment, education and contracting.
Professors Grodin and Varat thought repeal by the
Legislature would be.constitutional.

Professor Landsberg pointed out that under the Crawford
decision “the simple repeal or modification of
desegregation or anti-discrimination laws, without more,
never has been viewed as embodying a presumptively
invalid racial classification.” However, he pointed out
four circumstances when repeal of affirmative action laws
could raise constitutional concerns:

e Ifthe intent were to disadvantage a racial minority;

e If the ability to remedy. the effects of past
discrimination were removed;

e Iflocal governments lost their home rule authority to
adopt affirmative action programs;
