subsidy. (See 798.44.4(b) at page A-
11).

° No residents of a park are eligible to
receive the subsidy until less than
10% of the park spaces are covered
by rent control. (See 798.44.4(a)(1)
at page A-10). The proponents
admit that the average mobilehome
turnover period is 10 years. It will
take nearly a decade to reach the
10% level. (See "The California
Mobilehome Fairness Initiative:
Background for Policy Makers,"
April 1995 at page 1.)

. The combined number of spaces
receiving subsidies and spaces on
rent control cannot exceed 10%. (See
798.44.4(a)(2) at page A-10).

° Only residents in a "very low income
household" would qualify. (See
798.13(b) at page A-5 or A-6. As an
example of who would qualify, a
Fresno County couple would need an
annual gross income of less than
$13,850.00.

FALSE.

The subsidy is a mirage. It is defined as a

10% discount on the pre-subsidy rent as
i wner. (See 798.13(c)

at pages A-6 and A-7).

» But the only limit on the pre-subsidy rent is

that it cannot exceed the average monthly
rent charged for all spaces in the park.

In the real world, in any mobilehome park,
there will be spaces that rent for 10% less
than the average. All management need do
under this Initiative is to designate these
spaces as "rental assistance" spaces. In this
circumstance, management could comply
with the Initiative without lowering or
subsidizing anyone’s rent.

Because the Initiative will phase out
existing rent control, management has the
right to impose unlimited rent increases
before the 10% "rental assistance subsidy" is
calculated. Those who receive the "subsidy"
may actually see their rent increase, not
decrease.
