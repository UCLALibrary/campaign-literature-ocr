On March 26 Vote “NO” on Proposition 197

| pple tore Rete a

I am a volunteer for the “NO on 197” campaign to defeat the attempt of the NRA and
others to allow the trophy hunting of cougars in California. The Humane Society of
the United States, California State Park Rangers, and Sierra Club all oppose Proposi-
tion 197.

Under existing law, state authorities are permitted to kill any cougar who poses a
threat to public safety or livestock. Proposition 197 is an attempt by the gun lobby to
allow hunters to kill hundreds of lions every year for trophies.

The California primary is March 26, and it is important that you vote in this election.
The fate of cougars will be determined by whether people like you vote on March 26
(or send in an absentee ballot in advance).

Please vote “NO” on 197. Thank you.

Sincerely,

PS. You can register to vote by calling your county’s Voter Registration Office (located under the govemment listings
section in the white pages of your phone directory). If you’re not registered, do so before February 26, 1996.
