We cannot afford NOT to cut taxes.

I’m not talking about “revenue neutral” tinkering with the tax
code, the usual shell game in Washington that pretends to cut some
taxes while raising others. I’m not talking about marginal tax cuts
that help only the well-to-do, or even the $500 tax credit being fought
over so hard these days, which, even if it passes, will be a mere drop
in the bucket of what is needed for future growth and prosperity.

We need dramatic, pro-growth tax cuts -- tax cuts that are deep,
wide and permanent, that reach down to all American families and
businesses -- especially small businesses -- and get the suffocating
weight of the IRS off our backs.

Start by scrapping the tax code. Don’t fiddle with it. Throw it
out. Put as many IRS bureaucrats as possible into job retraining.

Replace it with a flat tax that is a tax cut -- a pro-growth, pro-
family tax cut that lowers tax rates to 17 per cent across the board
and expands exemptions for individuals and children so that a family
of four would pay no taxes on the first $36,000 of income.

Not one cent to the IRS on the first $36,000 of income.

Anything more than that would be taxed at a flat, fair 17 per cent.

This would mean that families living at the median household
income would pay practically nothing to Uncle Sam in taxes.

The flat tax would be so simple, you could fill it out on a post
card. A post card that would say, in effect, having a wonderful time;
glad most of my money is here.

It would be honest. It would eliminate the principal source of
political corruption in Washington -- trading loopholes for campaign

cash. It would be fair. Millions of people would be off the tax rolls.
