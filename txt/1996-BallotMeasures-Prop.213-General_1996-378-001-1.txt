California Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, HONORARY CHAIR

PROPOSITION 213
THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996

MYTHS AND FACTS

MYTH: Uninsured and/or drunk drivers will be unable to sue for medical and out-of-pockets expenses if
they are involved in an accident with an insured driver.

FACT: Proposition 213 protects all uninsured drivers -- even drunk drivers -- involved in an accident with
an insured driver and allows them to recover all of their expenses, including medical costs.

MYTH: Proposition 213 makes criminals out of poor people.

FACT: Proposition 213 does not criminalize any activity. It simply stops rewarding people who break the
law. Regardless of financial status, it is AGAINST THE LAW to drive under the influence of
alcohol or drugs in California. In most cases it’s also against the law to drive without insurance.

MYTH: Proposition 213 is unfair to people who cannot afford insurance.

FACT: Unfortunately, thousands of people ignore drunk driving and requisite insurance laws and get
rewarded for it. Drunk drivers and uninsured motorists can sue law-abiding citizens for huge
monetary awards in addition to being compensated for medical and other expenses. THESE
HUGE AWARDS COST CALIFORNIANS WHO PLAY BY THE RULES AND OBEY THE
LAW $327 MILLION IN PERSONAL AUTO INSURANCE COSTS EVERY YEAR! That’s not
fair! Proposition 213 will save hundreds of millions of dollars every year for law-abiding citizens
who buy insurance and will help make auto insurance more affordable for everyone. In Los
Angeles County, the average savings for a person buying auto insurance will be about $84.

Proposition 213 will STOP drunk drivers, convicted felons and uninsured motorists from
collecting these huge monetary awards, while still protecting their right to be compensated for
medical and out-of-pocket expenses. That is fair.

MYTH: Convicted felons are already prohibited from recovering damages if they are accidentally injured
while fleeing from their crime.

FACT: Some convicted felons are prohibited from suing, but many dangerous criminals can sue their
victims, innocent bystanders, “deep pocket” local governments or anyone else who gets in their
way while fleeing from their crime. Crimes such as carjacking; murder by carjacking; murder by
drive-by shooting; and ATM robbery are not included in current laws. Still other crimes simply
were not referenced in the original law. PROPOSITION 213 PROHIBITS ALL FELONS FROM
SUING AND PROFITING FROM THEIR CRIMES.
