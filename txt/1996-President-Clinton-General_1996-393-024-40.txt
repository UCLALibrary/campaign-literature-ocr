Medicare & Medicaid

®& Last year, Bob Dole voted for a budget bill (H.R.
2491) that cut Medicare by $1,700 per beneficiary by
the year 2002. The measure also would have increased
“Part B’ premiums for Medicare recipients to 31.5%.
The same bill targeted Medicaid reimbursements for
deep cuts, potentially forcing up to 700 urban — tural

hospitals to close their doors.
(Congressional abeig 1/20/96)

& In 1965, Bob Dole was one of a handful of congress-
men who voted against the creation of Medicare. Last
year, Dole said he was proud to have opposed Medicare
from the very start: “I was there, fighting the fight, voting
against Medicare — one of 12 — because we knew it

wouldn’t work in 1965.”
(Speech tothe American Conservative Union, 10/24/95)

= Asanalternative to the President’s health care reform
package, Dole introduced a bill that set strict limits on
spending for Medicaid. So strict were the limits that
two Republican governors — South Carolina Governor
Carroll Campbell and Wisconsin Governor Tommy
Thompson— publicly opposed Dole’s bill. Ina letter to
Dole, they and other several governors wrote: “This
action imposes a significant unfunded mandate on states
and could result in state budget crises.”

Insurance Reform

@ In 1994, Bob Dole led the fight against President
Clinton’s plan to guarantee basic health coverage for all
Americans. He led a voting bloc that threatened to
filibuster (requiring the support of 40 senators) or use
other tactics to prevent the President’s reform package
from moving forward. Dole even bragged that “once we
had the 40 votes, we had more votes than anybody in the
Congress so we knew that nothing was going to pass.”
[Speech tothe Conservative Political Action Conference, 2/10/95]

® Dole told a group of business leaders that government
had no role to play in helping to gain health care cover-
age for those who are not covered. The senator said that
there is no crisis in health care and that failing to pass a
reform bill “would not be the end of the world.” Dole’s

HEALTH CARE

insistence that no crisis exists was a a dramatic change
from 1971 when he commented ona speech by then-
President Nixon: “This message recognizes the present
health care crisis in our nation.” By 1994, the nation’s
health care costs were 11 times higher than they were in
1971.

Record, 2/19/71, p. 3310; Office of National Health Statistics, 1995)

Children’s Health

@ Senator Dole has a long record of opposition to ex-
panding immunization programs to reach more children.
Last year, he supported a bill that would have repealed
the Vaccines for Children program — reducing federal
funds for curricula and programs. In 1981, Dole voted
against a bill to provide $6 million for child immuniza-
tions. One year later, he opposed another bill providing
the same level of funding for vaccinations.

(Congressional Quarterly, 1/20/96; Vote on Senate Conference Bill, 4/2/81;

Vote on Supplemental Appropriations Bill, 9/10/82)

® In 1994, Dole voted against an amendment to the
health care reform bill that required insurance policies
to cover preventive services for children at no extra cost,
including prenatal care for pregnant women. The
amendment— supported by President Clinton — passed
anyway.

(Vote on Senate Bill 2351, 8/16/94)

1 Despite figures showing that 3,000 adolescents try

smoking each day and 1,000 of them eventually die from
smoking related illnesses, Dole has suggested that cigar-
ettes aren’t addictive: “We know it’s not good for kids,
but a lot of other things aren’t good ... some would say
milk’s not good.” Dole said he opposes federal action to
help prevent cigarette sales to minors.

(Louisville Courier-Journal, 6/15/96)

Family & Medical Leave
@ Between 1991 and 1993, Bob Dole voted against

the Family and Medical Leave Act on three separate
occasions, calling the measure too costly for business.
When a bill to allow up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave was
proposed in 1988, Dole led the filibuster that effectively
killed the bill.
