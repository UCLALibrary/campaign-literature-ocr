These campaign activities do not come for free. It takes money to print
brochures and to produce commercials.

The park owners may have a few wealthy campaign contributors, but GSMOL,
with more than 55,000 members statewide, has true grassroots strength in numbers.

stop the Mobilehome Eviction Initiative.

PS. -- Your membership dues today are vital to defeating the Mobilehome Eviction
Initiative. Without adequate funds, we won't be able to get our message out, and the
park owners will use their millions to spread lies and distortions that we won't be able
to answer. Please be generous -- people's homes are at stake!
