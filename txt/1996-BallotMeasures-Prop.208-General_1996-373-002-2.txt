Why We Oppose the So-called "Anti-Corruption Act of 1996"

the same day that CPR turned in over 700,000 signatures for the California Political Reform
Initiative sponsored by the League of Women Voters, Common Cause, American Association
of Retired Persons (AARP) and United We Stand America (UWSA).

CalPIRG was originally part of the CPR coalition but chose to go its own way. We
believe that CalPIRG has made a series of Serious policy and technical errors that has created
a fatally flawed initiative that would result in a giant step backward for campaign reform in
California.

The ACA would gut the Ethics in Government Act.

Inexplicably, the ACA would repeal, without replacing, major portions of the cornerstone of
California's anti-corruption laws, the Ethics in Government Act. The ACA would eliminate
the ban on honoraria (speaking fees, etc.) for all candidates for elective office, local
government officials and members of State boards and commissions. This would mean
special interests could make direct cash payments to them personally, circumventing all
campaign finance restrictions entirely. The ACA would also allow state elected officials,
state legislative and local officials, and candidates for elective office to accept unlimited gifts
and free travel from special interest contributors.
