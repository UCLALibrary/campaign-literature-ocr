President & CEO

Granite Construction e EARTHQUAKE REINFORCEMENT WORKS Every bridge strengthened in
Company Southern California with state-of-the-art technology came through the Northridge

quake intact, keeping emergency relief and commerce flowing.

e EVERY CALIFORNIAN WILL BENEFIT Funds for critically needed highway and
passenger rail projects: throughout California are being shifted to pay for
earthquake safety repairs. If Prop. 192 fails, projects in the State Transportation
Improvement Plan will be delayed 2-4 years and nearly half a billion dollars
worth of projects will be dropped out of the STIP.

e DISASTER RECOVERY IS IMPROVED When highways or freeways are seriously
damaged in earthquakes, problems are not just limited to the areas of damage.
An entire system used by tens of thousands of motorists is paralyzed for miles
around, obstructing firefighters, rescue workers and relief supplies. And it
undermines our state's economy for years.

e EARTHQUAKES HIT TAXPAYERS’ POCKETS Following the Loma Prieta quake,
state taxpayers were forced to pick up the tab for rebuilding. Proposition 192
will help avoid a similar shock to taxpayers.

° BRIDGE STRENGTHENING IS CHEAPER THAN RECONSTRUCTION Retrofitting
can be completed at 10 percent of rebuilding costs.

e A BOOST FOR OUR ECONOMY Historically, earthquake damage on state
highways has led to the loss of billions of dollars to our economy as we are
forced to adjust to closed freeways and bridges. Proposition 192 will create
jobs and make California's economic future more secure.

e FUNDS MAY BE SPENT ONLY ON EARTHQUAKE SAFETY REPAIRS They cannot
be diverted to other uses.

° WE CAN'T WAIT Without passage of Proposition 192, safety repairs will fall
further behind. California has suffered two devastating earthquakes in six years.
’ The next could happen tomorrow.
