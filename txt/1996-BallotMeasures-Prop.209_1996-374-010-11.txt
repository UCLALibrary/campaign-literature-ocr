Professor Varat suggested two potential flaws in the
legislative counsel’s argument. First, the initiative in the
Reitman case specifically would have allowed racial
discrimination by private individuals, whereas the
proposed CCRI expressly forbids public discrimination.
Second, Professor Varat notes a distinction between
voluntary affirmative action plans that are
constitutionally permissible, and affirmative action plans
that are constitutionally compelled as a remedy for past
discrimination.

Many public affirmative action programs are voluntary,
permissive and are not compelled. When a public
Program is permissive, the state is not involved in
remedying direct evidence of past discrimination.
Therefore, in Professor Varat’s opinion, the ban on racial
and gender preferences would not be unconstitutional on
its face as the legislative counsel had suggested.

Third Argument

A third possible argument challenging the validity on its .
face of the ban on preferences is the strongest, according
to Professors Grodin, Landsberg and Varat. To
paraphrase Professor Varat, the argument is framed as
follows: By singling out race- and gender-based
affirmative action programs, the initiative would
unconstitutionally impair the equal ability of minorities
and women to pursue beneficial legislation through the
political process. Under this analysis, Professor
Landsberg believes the ban would be unconstitutional;
Professors Grodin and Varat believe the argument would
not prevail and the constitutionality of the ban would be
upheld.

The third argument was based on a series of U.S.
Supreme Court cases: Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385
(1969); Washington v. Seattle School District, cited above;
Crawford v. Los Angeles Board of Education, 458 U.S. 527
(1982); and Romer v. Evans, No. 94-1039, cert. granted
Feb. 17, 1995 (reviewing 882 P. 2d 1335).

The principle established in Hunter and Seattle, Professor
Landsberg said, “is the state may not use ‘the racial
