QUICK FACTS:

¢ Marinol was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1985
for treatment of nausea in cancer chemotherapy; its use in AIDS
treatment was approved in 1992. These FDA approvals directly
contradict opponents’ claims that medical marijuana is a “cruel hoax.”

¢ Marinol is produced by Unimed Pharmaceuticals of Buffalo Grove,
Illinois, and distributed by Columbus, Ohio-based Roxane Laboratories.

¢ Marinol was not created for medical use — it was synthesized in the
1970s by federal government researchers for drug abuse research on
animals.
