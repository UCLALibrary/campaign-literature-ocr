BRAD SHERMAN

Working with Common Cause for political reform.

One of Brad Sherman’s most important volunteer
activities has been his work with Common Cause. Brad
served on the California Board of Directors of that
political reform organization from 1984 to 1989.

Brad Sherman represented California Common Cause
on tax reform issues, successfully persuading the state
legislature to triple the child-care tax credit and to
close special interest corporate tax loopholes.

As a student in 1973, Brad helped Common Cause
draft the California Political Reform Act. In 1988, he
actively worked for the passage of Proposition 68,
Common Cause’s campaign reform initiative. Later he
helped enact tough new conflict of interest regulations
for state office holders.

Brad’s commitment to reform continues to this day.
Last year he helped Common Cause, the American
Association of Retired Persons, and the League of
Women Voters draft their campaign reform initiative
which will appear on the November 1996 ballot. Brad
Sherman is one of only four California elected officials
who is supporting this crucial initiative.

No wonder retiring Congressman Tony Beilenson calls
Brad Sherman, “a man of integrity and independence.”

“My work with Common Cause left me with an undying
commitment to fight for political and ethics reform.”
