ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT

THE NATURAL LAW PARTY will create a
future in which renewable, nonpolluting, inex-
pensive energy is abundantly available, the air
in our cities is pure and clean, and our rivers
and lakes are free of pollution. We foresee a time
when waste is efficiently managed; when the
needless destruction of forests and species di-
versity has ceased; when there are many more
parks, gardens, and fountains; when new jobs
have been created to develop renewable energy
sources, conserve energy, and protect the envi-
ronment; and when global cooperation ends the
threats to the future of humankind, such as ozone
depletion and the greenhouse effect.

THE PROBLEM

The standard of living and the economic vitality
of the United States depend on the increasing
availability of inexpensive, clean, renewable
sources of energy.

Until now, the U.S. has relied mainly on fossil
fuels. Coal, oil, and natural gas account for the
majority of energy used for electricity, heat,
transportation, and industry. However, these fu-
els are nonrenewable and limited in supply. Their

_ use results in air pollution, acid rain, pollution

from mercury and other contaminants, the threat
of global warming, and other environmental
hazards that may endanger future generations
with irreversible global changes [1].

The Federal Government indirectly subsidizes
our dependence on fossil fuels by spending tax
dollars to correct the environmental and health-
related damage caused by airborne pollutants.
In addition, at the earth summit in Brazil, where
all nations assembled to address global environ-
mental concerns, the U.S. Government took a
stand to protect economic interests that it per-
ceived to be in conflict with environmental in-

terests. Protecting the environment was equated
with loss of jobs, increased costs of goods, and
loss of economic vitality.

According to a 1995 report from the Department
of Health and Human Services, environmental
toxins are responsible for 14% of annual deaths
in America. A 1996 study by the Natural Re-
sources Defense Council, a Washington, D.C.,
environmental group, found that air pollution
kills 64,000 Americans a year—a higher death
toll than for auto accidents [2]. The indirect costs
of pollution, such as those associated with health
care and acid rain, are incalculable; they effect
tourism, overall quality of life, and many other
areas [3].

In addition to the environmental hazards posed

35

by current energy use, the majority of our rivers
and streams are still so polluted from toxic agri-
cultural and industrial pollutants that they are
unsafe for swimming. Approximately 93% of the
virgin forests in the Pacific Northwest have been
cut (a nonrenewable resource), and most of the
remainder is scheduled to be cut in the next few
years—nearly all of it on public lands.
Biodiversity is being threatened at an alarming
rate, not only in our vanishing forests, but in the
oceans. Hundreds of thousands of sea mammals
are being exterminated by drift-net fishing. Ap-
proximately 50% of our wetlands that provided
habitats for wildlife have been destroyed, and
overgrazed prairie lands are being increasingly
eroded.

American dependence on foreign oil creates
political instability between the U.S. and the
Middle East. For example, the purpose of Desert
Storm, with its enormous attendant costs, was
primarily to defend U.S. oil interests in the Per-
sian Gulf region. This military operation should
be included in the cost of fossil fuel. Desert
