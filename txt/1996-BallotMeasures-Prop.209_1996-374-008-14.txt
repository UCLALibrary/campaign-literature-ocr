Numerous people and organizations have wondered about whether we can look to the courts to
save affirmative action programs should Proposition 209 pass. Many wonder if, like the fate of the
recent Proposition 187, the courts would block implementation of 209. Portions of 187 have been
found directly to conflict with the Federal Constitution, and numerous other portions are still being
evaluated by the courts. The result has been court intevention to prevent the implementation of 187.

However, Proposition 209 appears to be quite different from 187. When 187 was considered by
voters, a number of legal scholars expressed strong doubt as to the constitutionality of that Proposition.
Proposition 209 has now been examined by a number of scholars who span the political and ideological
spectrum. Although there is some disagreement on specific portions, there seems to be general a
agreement that the bulk of 209 is constitutional. Problems may exist with certain applications of 209,
but its general effect of eliminating affirmative action is not likely to be overruled by any court,
particularly not California’s highest court. Six of the nine justices on the California Supreme Court
were appointed by Republican Governors Deukmejian and Wilson, and reflect those governors’
conservative political ideologies. While legal challenges are nonetheless planned if 209 passes, our
chance of success in the courts appears to be quite slim. This makes it all the more imperative that we
go out and prevent 209 from passing in the first place rather than trust that we can defeat 209 later in
the courts.
