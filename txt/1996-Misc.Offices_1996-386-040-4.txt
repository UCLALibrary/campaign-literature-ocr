EARI YES
Controlled Use of Medical Marijuana

Allows legal use of marijuana for medical
purposes and protects from punishment
physicians who recommend marijuana to their
patients to treat symptoms of such diseases as
cancer or glaucoma. This would inexpensively
and safely ease pointless patient suffering and
protect patients and their caregivers from
unnecessary legal penalties.

Supporters: Californians for Medical Rights,
Assemblymember John Vasconcellos, SF
District Atty. Terence Hallinan

Opponents: Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, CA
Assn. of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs

YES

Protection of Patients’ Rights

Like Prop. 214, this will end “gag” clauses in HMOs that
lead to the denial of needed medical treatment. Both also
require written criteria and exam for denial of care. Both
end financial bonuses to doctors who withhold patient
treatments. Both mandate minimum safe staffing levels and
ensure confidentiality of all medical records. 216 also sets
up a consumer protection board and raises $2.5 billion for
county health services through fees on helath care businesses
with policies that harm communities such as closing clinics.

Supporters: CA Nurses Association, Ralph Nader,

Restore Top Income Tax Bracket

Restores the 10% and 119% tax rates (expired
in 1996) on the wealthiest 1.2% of taxpayers
in California. Divides this estimated $800
million in new revenue between schools and
local government. Restores some city and
county services that have been lost as the state
government has taken property tax revenue
away from counties.

How We Are Organizing
for a Progressive LA

is a multi-cultural alliance of progressive labor,
community and issue organizations and activists.

We work for social and economic justice by educating voters
countywide and organizing residents into district-by-district
precinct organizations with the power to change local policy.

For over a decade, we have educated voters countywide by
distributing hundreds of thousands of copies of this tabloid
door-to-door, through our member organizations and wherever
our communities gather. We are building precinct organizations

progressive local policies with immediate impact-such as
the Living Wage Ordinance.

In the future, these district coalitions will form
independent political action committees that will elect
coalition representatives to the Los Angeles City Council
giving the community a new level of participation and power

in making decisions that improve their lives.

Our vision is a city government aggressively implementing a proactive agenda of accountable police,
affordable housing, family-supporting jobs, quality education and a sustainable environment because it is
run by councilmembers elected, supported and held accountable by precinct organizations led by

Undemocratic System for Local Taxation

Amends state constitution to require a public vote on all government
fees and assessments — even forcing votes on those that have long
existed. Only property owners will be able to vote on assessments,
with large property owners getting muliple votes. Non-property
owners will not be able to vote even though assessments are often
passed through to them via rent and other fees. It also applies
other broad limits on local government revenue efforts which
undercut the ability to fund essential services.
