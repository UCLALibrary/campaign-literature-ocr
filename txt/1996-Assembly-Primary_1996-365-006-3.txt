STILL WONDER WHY FRANCINE OSCHIN
REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO SIGN THE
CLEAN CAMPAIGN PLEDGE?

TAKE A LOOK AT HER DIRTY CAMPAIGN.

The clean campaign pledge requires that candidates for public office

“uphold the basic principles of decency, honesty and fair play.” But
Francine Oschin isn’t playing fair.

Francine Oschin is running a campaign based on distortions and the

character assassination of her opponent. She doesn’t even tell us
where she stands on the issues.

Haven’t we had enough dirty politics over the years? Don’t we
deserve better?

There’s a Shark in the water...

BOB HERTZBERG SIGNED THE CLEAN
CAMPAIGN PLEDGE.

HE’S BEEN FIGHTING FOR ETHICS
REFORM FOR YEARS.

Bob Hertzberg thinks that election campaigns should be fair and
honest — and about issues. He also believes that elected officials

have an obligation to behave ethically. That’s why Bob Hertzberg
fights for political reform.

Bob served on the Executive Committee of Proposition 68, a

statewide campaign reform initiative; was Treasurer for Proposition
131 -Taxpayers for Clean Government; and fought for LA City’s
Ethics law.

On March 26, let’s elect an Assemblymember we can all be proud of.
Vote for Bob Hertzberg.
