13% among Americans between the ages of 18 and 35 since 1992 (Department of Health and
Human Services, Substance Abuse/Mental Health Agency, 8/20/96). Cocaine use is down 30%
since 1992 (ONDCP, April 1996). There is a record number of drug felons in federal prisons
(Letter from Attorney General Reno to Senator Orrin Hatch, 9/26/96). Border Patrol drug
seizures are up 22% (Department of Justice/ Immigration and Naturalization Service, 07/0796).
President Clinton has proposed and signed the largest anti-drug budgets in history, up 24% since
FY93; he elevated the Office of National Drug Control Policy to Cabinet level status; and he
appointed a four-star general, Barry McCaffrey, to lead the fight. By contrast, Bob Dole
opposed the creation of the Drug Czar’s office in 1982 and voted against its extension in 1994.
[1994 CQ Almanac, p.290] [CQ Almanac, 1982 (p.64-S)] Bob Dole voted to cut the Safe and
Drug Free Schools Program by 50%. The Dole-Gingrich budget cut $767 million for the
President’s 1996 drug control budget and cut at risk youth drug programs by over 50%. [CQ,
1994, vt 321, Impact of House Appropriations Subcommittee mark, FY95-97.]

THE CLAIM: “I have a better idea (will repeal the Brady bill).”

THE FACTS: President Clinton led the fight to gain Congressional passage of the Brady Law.
The Brady Law requires that a national Instant Criminal Background Check System be
established by November 1998. The Department of Justice has already appropriated $112
million in funding for states to create instant check systems.[Atty- General’s Report to President,
9/13/95, DoJ 9/96] In 1993, Dole voted against passage of the Brady Bill. [1993 CQ Almanac, p.
302; p. 51-S, vote # 394]. Upon voting against final passage, Dole stated: “We lost one.”
[Houston Chronicle, 11/25/93] Dole took the NRA position by leading the GOP filibuster of the
Brady Bill, voting twice against cloture, despite the fact that the bill represented a compromise
measure that he helped draft. [1993 COQ Almanac, p. 302; votes #387, #390, | 1/19/93, p. 50-S]

ATTACK: “Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.”

THE FACTS: Last month, Bill Clinton expanded the no-fly zone in southem Iraq in response
to Saddam’s seizure of Irbil in the north -- tightening the strategic straightjacket on Saddam. It is
now harder for Saddam to attack Saudi Arabia and Kuwait -- and easier for us to stop him if he
does. In 1993, he launched cruise missiles against Saddam’s intelligence headquarters to
retaliate for the attempted assassination of President Bush in 1993; in 1994, Bill Clinton
deployed American forces to counter Saddam’s deployment of forces toward Kuwait. Source:

Bob Dole’s record suggests that Saddam would be better off if Dole had been President. In 1990,
three and one-half months before the invasion, Bob Dole met with Saddam in Iraq, and upon his
return declared that Saddam is an “intelligent man,” a “leader to whom [we] can talk,” and that
there was a “chance to bring this guy around.” A month later, he derailed sanctions against
Saddam for his threat to burn up half of Israel. On July 27, 1990 -- on the eve of Saddam’s
