{In the campaign, we call him "the other Malcolm.”]

Well, the experts found that there were a few
surprises in store. Some dramatic ups -- and also downs.
But let me say this: the reasons | entered this race to begin
with still apply. I ran to represent certain principles --
principles of growth and opportunity, the hope of an
America whose future is bigger, more expansive, than her
past, and while no one else in this race represents that
hope and that challenge, I will.

This race is about a movement, not about a man. I am
in this race to battle for that movement, and as a great
general once said, I propose to hold this line if it takes all
summer.

I have faith that our ideas will prevail as voters
examine each candidate, then examine their own
conscience, then conclude as Senator Wallop and Senator
Humphrey have, that I am the only true conservative in the
race.

Now, our friends in the media are always talking
about the horse race, so let me say another word or two
about the horse race we're in.

I saw a report yesterday that Senator Dole and his
campaign have decided to stop calling other candidates
“extremists” -- a good thing in my book.

In the heat of a campaign anyone can get carried
away -- a human fault we probably all share.
