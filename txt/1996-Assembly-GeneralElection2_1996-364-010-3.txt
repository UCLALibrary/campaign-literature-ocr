We deserve an Assembly member who

will put the public’s interests first.

Debra Bowen. Independence and Integrity.

Debra Bowen is a different kind of leader. She is one of the few who really fights
for campaign reform. She refuses to accept gifts from lobbyists. She voluntarily
places her campaign contributions on the Internet so that everyone can see who
gives to her campaigns. Debra Bowen believes that public service is an honor
and a responsibility - and she would rather give up her office than sacrifice her
integrity.

Debra Bowen. Fiscal Watchdog.

As a member of the State Assembly, Debra Bowen makes it her business to
uncover fraud and mismanagement - and to make sure our tax dollars are used
wisely. She stopped the State from wasting nearly a billion dollars on an ill-
conceived computer system. She exposed backroom special interest dealings at
the State Lottery that cost our schools over $100 million.

Debra Bowen. Creative leadership.

Debra Bowen believes in the power of ideas. She works with Democrats,
Republicans, Libertarians, Greens, and Independents to solve California’s
problems. She has co-sponsored over a dozen bills with her Republican
colleagues in the Assembly.

Her hard work and commitment to the people of her district have won Debra
Bowen the respect and support of community leaders. Debra Bowen has earned
your support too.
