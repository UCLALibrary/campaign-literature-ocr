Medicare & Medicaid

& Last year, Bob Dole voted for a budget bill (H.R.
2491) that cut Medicare by $1,700 per beneficiary by
the year 2002. The measure also would have increased
‘Part B’ premiums for Medicare recipients to 31.5%.
The same bill targeted Medicaid reimbursements for
deep cuts, potentially forcing up to 700 urban and rural

hospitals to close their doors.
(Congressional Quarterly, 1/20/96)

@ In 1965, Bob Dole was one of a handful of congress-
men who voted against the creation of Medicare. Last
year, Dole said he was proud to have opposed Medicare
from the very start: “I was there, fighting the fight, voting
against Medicare — one of 12 — because we knew it

wouldn’t work in 1965.”
(Speech to the American Conservative Union, 10/24/95)

= Asanaltemative to the President’s health care reform
package, Dole introduced a bill that set strict limits on
spending for Medicaid. So strict were the limits that
two Republican governors — South Carolina Governor
Carroll Campbell and Wisconsin Governor Tommy
Thompson— publicly opposed Dole’s bill. Ina letter to
Dole, they and other several governors wrote: “This
action imposes a significant unfunded mandate on states
and could result in state budget crises.”

Insurance Reform

@ In 1994, Bob Dole led the fight against President
Clinton’s plan to guarantee basic health care for all
Americans. He led a voting bloc that threatened to
filibuster (requiring the support of 40 senators) or use
other tactics to prevent the President’s reform package
from moving forward. Dole even bragged that “once we
had the 40 votes, we had more votes than anybody in the
Congress so we knew that nothing was going to pass.”
[Speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, 2/10/95]

@ Dole told a group of business leaders that government
had no role to play in helping to gain health care cover-

The Dole Record

age for those who are not covered. The senator said that
there is no crisis in health care and that failing to pass a
reform bill “would not be the end of the world.” Dole’s
insistence that no crisis exists was a a dramatic change
from 1971 when he commented on a speech by then-
President Nixon: “This message recognizes the present
health care crisis in our nation.” By 1994, the nation’s
health care costs were 11 times higher than they were in
1971.

Record, 2/19/71, p. 3310; Office of National Health Statistics, 1995)

Social Security
® Dole sponsored legislation that would have repealed
the 1986 COLA (cost-of-living adjustments) for Social
Security. In 1994, he voted for a balanced budget
amendment that would have treated Social Security just
like any other federal program — placing the whole
system in jeopardy of cuts.

(National Council of Senior Citizens, 1996)

@ “Mr. Dole’s top Social Security adviser, the 44-
year-old Ms. (Carolyn) Weaver, has long pushed for
privatization ... Younger workers, [Dole] told an
insurance-company crowd, “might even opt out of Social
Security.’ ”

Retirement Savings
® Dole voted for a budget bill that included a provision
allowing employers to divertemployee pension funds

for other purposes.
(H.R. 2491, Congressional Quarterly, 1/2096)

@ In 1991, when the Older Americans Act came up for a
vote, Dole supported efforts to eliminate partial pensions
for 40,000 surviving retirees and spouses.
