Pat Buchanan
He Says What He Means
And He Means What He Says

LEADERSHIP

A Man With a Plan.

Pat Buchanan is a leader with vision. His
agenda — from immigration reform, to
economic patriotism, to using the pulpit
of the presidency to celebrate our heritage
and traditions — is grounded in the belief
that it is time for Americans to come
together again as one nation, one people,
under God.

EXPERIENCE

A Man With a Track Record.

Pat Buchanan has spent three decades on
the frontlines in America’s political battles.
He is schooled on issues from foreign

ed eight
years in the White House, as a senior

affairs to culture wars. He :

advisor to three presidents, attended five
summits, and knows what it takes to be
commander in chief.

CONSISTENCY

A Man You Can Trust.

Pat Buchanan is a lifelong Republican,
but doesn’t change his views to suit the
season’s fashion. When the Washington
establishment of the Republican Party
was wrong, he had the courage to stand
up against it. He opposed his own party
leaders when they raised taxes in 1990...
passed a quota bill in 1991... and approved
NAFTA in 1993. His politics are rooted in
principle. He is a man of his word.

Piccae I see an America where the
federal government is back under the
Constitution. I see an America where
the dream of equal justice for all and
special privilege for none has become a
reality. I see an America where the jobs
are coming home and no longer being
sent abroad. And I see an America
where we become one people, one
nation, one family, again. This is the
kind of America I’m working for and
fighting for.

With your help, we can make this
dream come true.

All we need is a new leadership of
courage and vision for this country
and we will get the job done. You can
rely upon me for that new leadership,
because I am a man who says what he
means and means what he says, a man
you can trust. Count on it.
