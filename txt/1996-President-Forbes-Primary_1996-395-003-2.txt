when the sun comes out we see that nothing is different -- except that
the glacier advanced just a little bit more in the night.

You, America’s small businessmen, know this better than
anyone else. You are the ones who drive economic growth and have
created most of the net new jobs in the last twenty years. You are the
greatest source of hope and opportunity in this nation, of an
expansive future that is greater than our past.

Small businesses are entrepreneurs with a dream... from high-
tech start-ups on the cutting edge of discovery to Mom -and -Pop
stores that bind our communities together. They are, in fact, over 90
per cent of all businesses in the U.S., with a combined economic
output greater than Germany or France or the United Kingdom.

Yet to Washington, small business is just a big pocket to be
picked -- a source of revenue, an easy mark to be squeezed for every
last tax dollar or mandated and regulated into extinction.

I believe small businesses should be growing larger, not the
bureaucracy that regulates you.

But that’s the “culture of Washington.” You can see it in the
very words used. Have you noticed how the Democrats and so-called
“moderate”: Republicans in Congress say things like “We can’t afford
a tax cut,” “We can’t afford a loss of revenue.” It’s revealing how
completely they identify themselves with the government -- and
against the people. And, you know, they are absolutely right. The
government, if it’s to grow ever bigger and more powerful, is never
going to be able to afford a tax cut.

But I'll tell you this, the American people cannot afford that

kind of government.
