Research Design

The evaluation rests on two related studies. reported respectively in
Part I and Part II of this document. The first, funded by the U. S. Department
of Labor (Employment and Training Administration), relies on 4 sample of over
1000 ex-offenders. The experimental group is defined as individuals who
a) apdited for the benefits upon release from prison, b) had acquired the
requisite earnings in prison, and ¢) received the benefits to which they were
entitled. The control group is defined as individuals who a) applied for the
benefits, b).did not acquire the requisite earnings in prison and c) did not
receive any benefits. Since receipt of benefits was determined by prison
earnings, ve are able to apply a regress ion-discontinuity ‘design that, in
principle, yields unbiased estimates of any treatment effects. In other words,
in a manner comparable to true experiments where subjects are assigned at
random to experimental and control groups, causal effects can be confidently
estimated with confounding influences eliminated (within the bounds of chance).
As the outcome for this analysis, we focus on offenses committed during the
first 12 months of parole that, for all practical purposes, lead to a new.”
incarceration.

The second study was funded by the California Department of Corrections.
In contrast to the first effort, the sample of offenders is very small: only
50 parolees are included. However, each of these 50 subjects were followed
cn a day-to-day basis for four months. Thus, breadth of coverage is traded .
for depth, and we are able to analyze 120 daily data points for each of the
5C. The basic question, therefore, is one of longitudinal mechanisms 5 iat
