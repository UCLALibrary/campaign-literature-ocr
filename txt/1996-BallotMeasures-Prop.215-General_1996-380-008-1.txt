THOUGHTS ON PROPOSITION 215

I receive a great deal of unsolicited mail. Recently, I received the book,
Cancer Treatment And Marijuana Therapy, as well as handouts from "Californians For
Medical Rights." On careful perusal, all of these publications espoused the use of
marijuana in treatment of cancer as a medical need.

Up for a vote in November 1996, is Proposition 215, also called "The Medical

Use of Marijuana Initiative". It seems that the folks at “Californians For Medical

Rights" are trying to enlist the votes and testimony of physicians who might use
marijuana in the future, in particular, cancer specialists and AIDS specialists. I
read many of the testimonials, as well as a recent commentary in the June 21, 1995
JAMA by Dr. Lester Grinspoon, who is part of the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard
University. Grinspoon and the testimonials push marijuana as a medicine, but it is
not FDA approved. The thrust seems to be that it helps a en vomiting, pain
and suffering and stimulates the appetite. Proposition 215 does not limit the use
of marijuana to AIDS, cancer, or glaucoma but “any illness for which marijuana
provides relief." One can be sure that this would extend to many other diseases and
even diseases with unclear boundaries, such as chronic fatigue syndrome and
hypoglycemia. Many of us remember when Kool cigarettes were being advertised as
helpful for the common cold.

As an oncologist, three areas are of interest to me: 1) Nausea and vomiting,
2) Pain, and 3) Appetite stimulation and well-being.

Most of the testimonials regarding nausea and vomiting in the books sent to me

were nine years old. This makes their discussion of the subject very passe as,
