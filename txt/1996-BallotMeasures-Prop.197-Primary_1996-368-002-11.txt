The Call To Manage California’s Top Predator,
The Mountain Lion

While many animal species in California are struggling to survive and others are being
considered for “threatened” or endangered” status, one California mammal has been given
such special protections that its overpopulation may be putting many other species in serious
danger, including deer, pets and people. This mammal is none other than the California
mountain lion. .

Since receiving its “specially protected mammal” status in 1990, casual sightings, which
were all but non-existent before that protection was imposed are now a daily occurrence in the
state. Further, attacks on livestock, pets and people have been on the rise while the deer
population in many parts of the state is rapidly declining. As the increase in lion population has
driven lions into suburban and urban neighborhoods in the state, many are now realizing that
the decision not to manage the population of California’s top predator was a bad decision.

In 1990, California’s voters narrowly passed Proposition 117 giving the mountain lion, a
species whose population has never been “threaténed” or “endangered”, status as a “specially
protected mammal,” thus affording it even greater protection than species which have been
designated “threatened” or “endangered,” Wildlife management specialists were effectively
prohibited from managing the population or responding to trends that may possibly place public
safety in jeopardy. Over the past five years, mountain lion management problems, as well as
dwindling state fiscal resources, have led the public and the Legislature to question the
mandates of Proposition 117 and our ability to balance the diverse interests inherent in this law.

This year, Senator Tim Leslie authored Senate Bill 28, in an effort to provide a practical
and reasonable alternative to California’s current flawed law. SB 28 placed a measure on the
March 1996 ballot that, if approved by the voters, will allow the Department of Fish and Game
to manage the mountain lion population in the same manner they manage all other species that
are not rare, threatened or endangered. SB 28 was drafted in response to the escalating
problem posed by the uncontrolled growth of California’s mountain lion population. The facts
illustrate the unforeseen problems set in motion when current law was implemented: over half
of the depredation permits issued by the Department of Fish and Game in the last 23 years
have been issued since Proposition 117 became law in 1990 and two-thirds of the 20th
century's “serious” incidents -- including at least two confirmed deaths -- have occurred in this
same brief period.
