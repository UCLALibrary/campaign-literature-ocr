TAXING TIMES T

WHAT IS PROPOSITION 218?

It’s your right to vote on taxes.

What is Proposition 218, the Right t
Vote on Taxes Act? :

Prop. 218 is an amendment to the
California Constitution which will guar-
antee the right to vote on local taxes,
even if these taxes are disguised under
other names like “assessments” and
“fees.” It will appear on the November
5, 1996 ballot.

How did Proposition 218 get on
the ballot — is this just another spe-

cial interest measure?

Prop. 218 was placed on the ballot
after thousands of taxpayers collected
over a million signatures of registered
voters. It is backed by taxpayers who
believe they have the right to be consult-
ed before government increases taxes.
Prop. 218 received no special interest
funding or support.

Desperate,

Opponents

Use “Big Lie” against
Proposition 218

The sky will not fall. The world will
not end. Civilization will not perish.
And big corporations won’t get new
voting rights with Proposition 218.
Opponents of Proposition 218 are
using something called the “big lie.”
You’ve seen it before — heated rhetoric,
bogeymen and dark predictions of doom
meant to strike terror in the hearts of voters.
Opponents of Proposition 218 claim
it gives big corporations and foreign
investors frightening new power over lit-
tle local taxpayers. Scary — but not true.
They say libraries will close, police
cars will stop rolling, fires will rampage
and earthquakes will go unanswered if it
passes. Do they have no shame?
Proposition 218 simply gives vot-
ers the right to vote on new local
taxes, assessments and fees.
Nothing scary about that to voters.

In fact, in a recent poll, 71% of
California voters said they want the right
to vote on new local taxes, assessments
and fees.

And why shouldn’t they. Local taxes
have soared 976% in California since 1978,
many imposed without voter consent.

Because Proposition 218 gives tax-
payers more control over the taxes they
pay, it’s endorsed by the California
Chamber of Commerce, the California
Taxpayers Association, 18 local tax
reform groups and 35 legislators.

Don’t be suckered by the “big lie.”
And remember who’s opposing
Proposition 218 — the people who keep
raising taxes, assessments and fees with-
out voter approval. ()

How does Proposition 218 guar-
antee my right to vote on local taxes?

Prop. 218, the Right to Vote on
Taxes Act, will amend the state constitu-
tion to guarantee Californians the right
to vote on local taxes and assessments.

Specifically, Proposition 218, the
Right to Vote on Taxes Act, will:

* require all new local taxes — like util-
ity user taxes — be submitted to vot-
ers for approval.
allow property owners to approve all
new assessments on property.
require existing assessments, that do not
directly benefit property, to be submitted
to property owners for ratification.
strictly limit the use of fees and
charges imposed on property owners.
provide local voters the right to use
the initiative to make changes in local
laws governing taxes, fees, assess-
ments and charges.

What do you mean by “strength-
en existing law”?

Today, because of court rulings, dif-
ferent cities have different vote require-
ments for taxes. Proposition 218 makes
it clear that residents of charter cities are

taxes as are residents of general law
cities and unincorporated areas.

Aren’t assessments on property
already limited under Proposition 13?

No, according to the courts, Prop.
13 covers only property taxes, not so-
called “benefit assessments” and
“maintenance assessments” on proper-
ty. However, for the average home-
owner who pays the bill, there is no
difference between taxes and assess-
ments — because failure to pay either
will result in a lien on the property.
Proposition 218 will establish uniform
rules for new assessments requiring
that property owners be sent ballots
and it will take a majority of ballots
cast to approve new assessments.

Under current law, protests by 50%
of all affected property owners are
required to stop an assessment, making
a successful protest as likely as win-
ning the lottery.

How will renters benefit from the
passage of Proposition 218?

First, Prop. 218 guarantees all regis-
tered voters the right to vote on general
and special purpose taxes. This includes
taxes on utilities that are paid by renters
and homeowners alike. Second, Prop.
218 for the first time gives renters, who

through their lease agreements are

obligated to pay assessments, the right
to protest. Under Prop. 218 those who
pay, including renters, vote.

Opponents say that Prop. 218 will

give corporations and non-residents a

chance to vote on my taxes.
Opponents are trying to confuse the

entitled to the same right to vote on — decide:

_ those who are taxed the right to decide.
