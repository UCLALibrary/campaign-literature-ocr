CRIME VICTIMS UNITED

A Non-Partisan Political Action Committee

Dear Fellow Citizen:

My nineteen year old daughter, so full of hope and promise, Was murdered on her

college campus.

Today—after only 17 years—the man who killed my daughter is eligible for parole.
Each time the State Parole Board considers his release from prison, my family is
forced to relive our pain and loss.

In their wisdom, the people of California passed the «Three Strikes-You're-Out™
Initiative. Since its passage, crime rates have plummeted and parolees by record
numbers have requested permission to leave California.

Unfortunately, last July, the Supreme Court struck down “Three Strikes,” allowing

serious repeat offenders to avoid prison.

Faced with this disaster, Assemblywoman Paula Boland went to work. AS
Chairperson of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, she successfully pushed
legislation through the State Assembly to restore our “Three Strikes” law. But,
Senate President Bill Lockyer defeated the legislation by just one vote in the Senate.
Now, crime victims are working to elect Paula Boland to the State Senate, SO
we'll continue to have her hard work and strong voice on our behalf.

Help us make our neighborhoods and schools safe from vicious criminals like the
one who killed my daughter by sending the attached petition to show your support
for “3 Strikes.” We've even paid the postage for you.

L urge you to please join with crime victims, police and prosecutors in
supporting Paula Boland for State Senate.

Nothing can bring back my daughter's life, but Assemblywoman. Paula Boland is
leading the fight to stop this tragedy from happening to your family.
