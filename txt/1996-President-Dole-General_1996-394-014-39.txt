TS96 88:

But Bill Clinton and Al Gore have been all
but honest with the youth of America...

Student Aid...

Bill Clinton and Al Gore say
they're going to give students a
tuition tax credit and more
money for student loans. But
who gets the money and who
gets the debt? The non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office
predicts that Clinton's Direct
Lending Program will cost us
$1.5 billion more than private

sector loans would over the next

7 years!

We already face a huge federal
deficit. Bill Clinton won't be
around when we have to pay it.
We can't allow Bill Clinton to
mortgage our future.

Taxes...

Bill Clinton and Al Gore prom-
ised to cut taxes in 1992. In
1993, they made the largest tax
increase in history. Now they
are promising to cut taxes
again? Remember the words of
U.S. Senator and DEMOCRAT
Bob Kerry: "Clinton's an unusu-
ally good liar.... Do you realize
that?‚Äù

Bill Clinton's tax increase
meant less jobs for young
people and increased gas prices.
Even Clinton admitted that he
raised our taxes too much in
1995. Who can you truly trust
to lower taxes?

Character. a

Bill Clinton and Al Gore have
sold us out for their own politi-
cal interests. They prefer to
sacrifice our future so they can
spend more money now. Even
Clinton's 96 budget

predicts $200 million deficits
for years to come.

The Clinton adminsitration
supports affirmative action,
which has led to more hostility
on our Campuses. Clinton also
slashed the budget for Drug
Control...now drug use has
doubled which means more of
our friends will suffer because
Clinton regrets not inhaling....

Vote for our interests....vote against Bill Clinton and Al Gore!
