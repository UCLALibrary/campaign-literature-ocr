CLAIM: “I feel strongly about education. I want to help young people have an education.”

THE FACTS: Bob Dole has a 35-year record of voting against education. In 1964 he voted
against the creation of Head Start [CQ Almanac, 1964], in 1965 he was 1 of only 63
representatives to vote against the creation of the federal student loan program [CQ Almanac,
1965 (vote #169), 10/25/65], and in 1979 he voted against the creation of the Education
Department [Senate vote #1070, 4/30/79]. In 1995, he teamed up with Newt Gingrich to write
the most anti-education budget in history, which would have cut education and training by $31
billion [FY96 budget resolution conference agreement; CBO analysis of the HR 2491, 11/16/95],
and voted to cut student loans [CQ Almanac, 1995, vote #231].

ATTACK: “He has deployed more troops than any President in history around the world.”
THE FACTS: Bob Dole needs help with his history. We deployed 20,000 troops to Bosnia.

We deployed 20,000 troops in Haiti. In World War I, we sent 8 million abroad. In the Gulf
War, we sent over half a million.
