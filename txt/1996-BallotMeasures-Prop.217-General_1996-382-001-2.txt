Proposition 217 is Good for Schools and Communities

Proposition 217 raises $860 million the first year and approximately $700 million each year thereafter.
About half of these revenues are constitutionally required to go to schools under Proposition 98. The
other half is directed towards local services such as police, firefighting, healthcare, parks and libraries.

Proposition 217 raises this revenue by keeping in place the‘ — two state income tax brackets of 10% and
11%, affecting only the wealthiest 1% of California taxpayer. These same rates have been in effect for
all but four years since 1973 when Ronald Reagan was Governor.

Proposition 217 has earned the support of a broad, non-partisan coalition including the League of
Women Voters of California, the California State PTA, Congress of California Seniors, Health Access,
the Sierra Club, the California Federation of Teachers, the California Professional Firefighters, the
California Coalition of Law Enforcement Agencies, California Teachers Association, State
Superintendent of Schools Delaine Eastin, the California State Association of Counties and hundreds of
county supervisors, mayors, city council and school board members and other community, labor and
religious leaders.

Remember to VOTE on November Sth and make an investment in your local schools and
community by voting YES on proposition 217!
