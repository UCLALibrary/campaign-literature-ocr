WHAT DOES PROP. 217 DO?

WHY DO OUR SCHOOLS & COMMUNITIES
NEED PROP. 217?

A= vote on The School and Community
Investment Initiative, Prop. 217:

gp aeaal California, many communities are in deep
fiscal trouble. Budget crises have led to crumbling
streets and roads, strained police and fire protection
services, loss of libraries, deterioration of parks and

+ Provides schools and communities with $860 million
in the first year and $700 million in each following
year without cutting or affecting any other state or
local programs and without new taxes.

Raises the revenue for schools and communities by

keeping the top state income tax brackets—which

expire this year—in place for the wealthiest 1% of

California taxpayers.

Distributes revenues to schools according to the

provisions of Prop. 98. About half the revenue raised

by Prop. 217 will go to schools.

+ Distributes revenues to local governments
proportionally according to the amount lost since the
state began shifting local property tax revenues in
1992. About half the revenue raised by Prop. 217
will go to communities.

+ Prevents Sacramento from shifting additional
property tax revenues away from cities and counties
in the future.

other vital local services. In addition, state spending on

schools has slowed in recent years while enrollment has
skyrocketed, crowding our children’s classrooms.

Our communities have been hurt by Sacramento’s
attempt to balance the state budget by taking billions of
dollars in property tax revenues away from cities and
counties, reducing the amount of local property tax
revenue available for local services. The annual shift of
local property taxes to the state now amounts to more
than $3.6 billion per year.

A “yes” vote on Prop. 217 will more fully and fairly
fund local services and provide additional support to
struggling schools.
