1974-1990, Fairfield, [A: MIU Press, 1990; see
also The Journal of Mind and Behavior 9:457-
486, 1988. Some specific examples include the
following:

¢ A day-by-day study of a two-month coher-
ence-creating assembly in Israel in 1983 showed
that, on days when the number of participants in
the assembly was high, war deaths in neighbor-
ing Lebanon dropped by 76%. During these two
months, crime, traffic accidents, and fires all de-
clined in Israel. Other possible causes (week-
ends, holidays, weather, etc.) were statistically
controlled for (Journal of Conflict Resolution
32:776-812, 1988.)

* Coherence-creating assemblies in Manila, New
Delhi, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C., all
corresponded with statistically significant de-
clines in violent crime. In these studies, alterna-
tive explanations were explored and could not

account for the findings (The Journal of Mind
and Behavior 8:67-104, 1987).

¢ The most recent replication occurred in 1993
in Washington, D.C., one of the most crime-rid-
den capitals in the world. In this carefully con-
trolled two-month study, a coherence-creating
group increased from 800 to 4,000 over the two-
month period. Although violent crime had been
steadily increasing during the first five months
of the year, soon after the start of the study, vio-
lent crime began decreasing and continued to
drop until the end of the experiment (maximum
decrease 20%), after which it began to rise again.
The effects of the group could not be attributed
to other possible causes, including temperature,
precipitation, weekends, and police and commu-
nity anticrime activities. (See Institute of Sci-
ence, Technology and Public Policy, Fairfield,
Iowa, Technical Report ITR—94:1, 1994.)
