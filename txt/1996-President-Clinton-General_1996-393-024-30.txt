Now, a few words
from Senator
Bob Dole:

It was “a bad idea when | voted against it

in the Senate. It’s a worse idea now.”
Dole, giving his opinion on Goals 2000 — the initiative to help facilitate state-based
efforts to establish rigorous academic standards for public schools.
(Dole press release, 7/21/95)

“| was there, fighting the fight, voting
against Medicare — one of 12 — because

we knew it wouldn’t work in 1965.”
Dole, explaining why he was proud to have opposed Medicare from the very start.
In 1995, Dole voted for deep cuts in Medicare that would have cost each beneficiary
$1,700 by the year 20002. President Clinton vetoed the Medicare cuts.
(Speech to the American Conservative Union, 10/24/95)

“This is not an urgent matter.”’

Dole, referring to the Family and Medical Leave Act, proposed to give working parents
time off to care for newborns, or family members who are ill. Dole voted three times
against the Act. It was finally signed into law by President Clinton in 1993.
