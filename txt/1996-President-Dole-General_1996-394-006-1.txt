Twelve Important Messages to
American Women
from the Republican Party

Republicans are putting women in positions of
power. A historic number of women have
been appointed to chairmanships of promi-
nent committees and leadership positions in
the 104th Congress—positions that few
Democrat women enjoyed during their
Party’s 40 years of control.

Republicans are supporting American families
by offering a $500 per child tax credit—that
means families can take $500 off their
federal taxes for each child.

Republicans are listening to women. Republi-
cans are enabling welfare parents to work by
providing them an additional $2.4 billion in
affordable childcare. Republicans are going
after dead beat parents who live in comfort
across state lines, while their families suffer
at home.

Republicans are restoring dignity to welfare
recipients by encouraging personal responsi-
bility, breaking a cycle of dependency and
enabling women on welfare to provide for
their families and themselves.

Republicans are fighting for a balanced budget
to provide tax relief for middle class families.
Under Bill Clinton, American families are losing
37% of their income to taxes—meaning that
one spouse is working just to pay the
government.

Republicans increased the Social Security
earnings limit, enabling senior citizens who
work to keep more of what they earn.
