Working people are under attack. But the real story of
anti-worker legislation doesn’t make the evening news.

Did you know that last year the i i i
California Legislature considered \ {

bills that would:

[J Repeal overtime pay after
eight hours work in a day?

[J Dismantle prevailing wage
standards for the construction
industry?

{} Contract out public
services — including fire and
police protection — to low-
wage, non-union employers?

LY Reduce fines to

agricultural employers who
fail to provide toilets in the
fields for the farmworkers who ae
harvest our food?

These bills and many more like
them will become law next year if
anti-worker candidates in just a
handful of seats are elected on

November 5th.
