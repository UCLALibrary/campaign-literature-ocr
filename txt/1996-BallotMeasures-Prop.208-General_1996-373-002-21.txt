The Chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee, the insurance industry's chief lobbyist, and four other
lawmakers were sent to federal prison in connection with the ongoing legislative scandal of selling laws for
campaign contributions. These scandals culminated 20 years of "fire sale" legislative bargaining over special
interest laws which cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars in higher prices for everything from
insurance premiums to milk. California must have new reforms to slap enforceable limits on special interest
spending, ban off-year fundraising, and do something to crack down on lobbyist abuses.

CALPIRG's snappy off-the-top-of-their-head response to criticism that the courts will never allow
their measure to be enforced is laced with pollsters’ "hot button" words:

"Every major social change in this country, including the abolition of slavery, women's
suffrage, anti-trust laws, all were originally ruled illegal or unconstitutional by the
courts."”

Their rhetoric, like their measure, casts little substantive light on their ability to ever enforce their reforms.
Are they trying to tell us slavery was abolished by paying lawyers to persuade the US Supreme Court to
overturn the Dred Scott decision? Did the US Supreme Court change its mind on women's suffrage or was
the 19th Amendment enacted? CALPIRG's reforms are like its rhetoric: Lots of spice, but 20 minutes later,
you're still hungry.

With the discovery of the repeal of the ban on honoraria, voter approval of the CALPIRG initiative doesn't
just leave us with no reform, it actually takes us backward to what the law was before the FBI started
investigating the use of honoraria to "rent" public officials in California.

That's why the League of Women Voters of California, American Association of Retired Persons,
Common Cause, and United We Stand America are supporting the California Political Reform Act.
