¢ Friends and family of the car owner who are passengers would be unaffected by this initiative.
The initiative would apply only to an injured person who drives drunk or is an uninsured
operator. If the owner of the car is uninsured and is a passenger with an uninsured driver, that
uninsured owner would also be ineligible for a non-economic monetary award.

What i I See nttion 2135 ae

e It will reduce the cost of insurance. The California Department of Insurance estimates this
initiative will reduce auto insurance costs by $327,000,000 during its first year. Savings vary
by region, with the average L.A. driver’s costs being reduced by $84 a year.

¢ It will reduce the number of uninsured motorists on the road. Cheaper insurance and the more
serious consequences for driving uninsured will increase the number of insured drivers.

e It would allow felons to collect damages only for intentionally inflicted injuries sustained
during the commission of, or flight from, a felony.

e It would allow drunk and uninsured drivers to collect only out-of-pocket (economic) damages,
like medical expenses and lost wages.

Und ee icted fel es

¢ Current law bars felons from recovering for their injuries only if they commit specific
felonies. As new crimes are defined in the law, loopholes are created. For example, a
convicted carjacker who commits murder during his or her crime, would be able to sue a
victim or any other bystander who accidentally injures him/her.

¢ Current law only protects the owners of property where a specific felony occurs. It doesn’t
stop a felon from suing a worker, bystander or witness for negligence.

e Current law only applies to injuries sustained on the property where the felony occurs. It

doesn’t apply to injuries sustained while fleeing the scene of the crime.

Proposition 213 corrects all three of these deficiencies in current law.
