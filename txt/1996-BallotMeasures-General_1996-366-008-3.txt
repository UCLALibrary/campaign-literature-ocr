The Los Angeles County
Lifeguard Association

Dear Friends,

Every day — winter and summer, Los Angeles
County Lifeguards patrol our beaches, always ready
to brave large surf, swift currents and freezing water
to rescue people in danger.

But today Santa Monica Bay and our beaches need
our help. With 60 million visitors every year, we need
to keep our beaches clean and protect water quality
in our Bay. That’s why we support Prop. A.

Prop. A includes specific funds to help clean up
our beaches, fight pollution, and restore water quality
in Santa Monica Bay.

Our beaches are a national treasure - and they belong
to us all. Prop. A will protect our beautiful beaches
and keep Santa Monica Bay safe for swimming.

Please join us in supporting Prop. A. Vote YES on
A - for Clean, Safe Beaches - for us and our Children.

Steve Mosely, President
Los Angeles County Lifeguard Association
