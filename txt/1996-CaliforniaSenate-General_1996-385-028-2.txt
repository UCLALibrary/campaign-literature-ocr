Lawyer Adam Schiff talks “tough” on criminals and illegal immigration.
But “tough” prosecutors don’t let dangerous criminals, including those who
smuggle illegal aliens into America, go free. The fact is, Adam Schiff is
misleading voters when he claims he never lost a case, because his plea
bargains have put our children and neighborhoods at risk.

We would be safer if Adam Schiff had never practiced law.

That’s a fact.

And that’s why Adam Schiff’s election would be a dangerous shift to the
left for our community.
