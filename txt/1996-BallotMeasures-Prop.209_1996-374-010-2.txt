Senate Colleagues:

This discussion of the proposed California Civil Rights Initiative by four constitutional scholars
who teach at four noteworthy law schools in California is offered for your information. I hope
you will find it well-reasoned and informed.

The law professors agreed to provide their opinions of the constitutionality of the various sections
of the initiative, which generally would ban preferential treatment based on race, gender and
ethnicity in public employment, contracting and education.

They determined, to varying degrees, that precedents exist for determining parts of the initiative
unconstitutional, particularly if they were to negate programs aimed at remedying evidence of past
discrimination by public entities in California.

I hope you will find this document useful as you weigh for yourselves the issues surrounding this
proposal.

Sincerely,

cx

BILL LOCKYER,
President pro Tempore
California State Senate
