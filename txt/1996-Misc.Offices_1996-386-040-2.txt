Authorizes $995 million in bonds to finance
environmental restoration, flood control, and
water conservation, management, and
recycling. Water management and
conservation are critical issues for California
and these funds are overdue.

Supporters: CA League of Conservation

SF Bay Assn., Assn. of CA Water Agencies

Opponents: Libertarian Party

Prison Construction Bond =

$700 million in bonds for building and repairing
county correctional facilities to be paid back at $50
million/yr. for 25 years. CA is already second after
‘Texas in prison population per capita and the danger
is that “if we build them, we will fill them” (and
then we have to pay millions more to operate them).
Scarce public dollars are better spent on fighting the
root causes of crime — the lack of educational
opportunities, child care, youth programs, and jobs.
Supporters: CA State Sheriffs’ Assn., CA District
Attorneys’ Assn.

Opponents: American Friends Service Committee,
National Lawyers Guild

Veteran Home Loan Bond =

$400 million in bonds to provide low interest loans to
veterans to purchase homes and farms. This program
would benefit many veterans in need at little or no cost to
the taxpayer. However, this program assists all veterans
including those not in need, while many non-veterans in
need are overlooked. This program also largely duplicates
the federal VA program. Coalition LA was just short of
a 2/3 vote required to recommend a Yes.

Supporters: CA Assn. of County Veterans Service
Officers, CA Assn. of Realtors, CA Labor Federation,

All state senators and assemblymembers
Opponents: Coalition to End Homelessness

Regressive Campaign Finance Measure Ban on Affirmative Action

Guarantee Public's Right to Attorney

Contingency fees (rather than up-front
hourly fees) are the only way most lower
income people get into court. Last March,
Prop 202 threatened consumers’ ability to
hire attorneys by limiting contingency fees.
This measure was designed to combat the
threat of measures like 202. Fortunately,
Prop. 202 failed. Still, this initiative will
restrain the legislature from enacting future
anti-consumer efforts.

Supporters: Consumer Attorneys of
California

Opponents: CA Chamber of
Commerce, National Federation of
Independent Businesses

Prop. 208 moves away from Coalition LA's goal of
giving everyone equal influence in elections. Places
strict limits on contributions by unions and their PACs
—which business interests can avoid — yet still allows
relatively large individual contributions. This
combination empowers affluent individuals at the
expense of low and moderate income people. Restricting
the political role of unions undercuts the primary way
low and moderate income people organize their political
contributions. See page 5 for details.

Supporters: CA Common Cause, AARP League
of Women Voters, United We Stand America, Howard
Jarvis Taxpayers Association, The Green Party, CLCV
Opponents: Cal. Labor Fed., Mexican American
Political Association , Service Employees International

Union (SEIU), ACORN, CA Teachers Association

Eliminate all public equal opportunity affirmative action
programs. As alternatives to these programs, this
California “civil wrongs” initiative offers only racial
division, gender exclusion, and open discrimination.
Prop. 209’s dangerously vague language also allows
discrimination against women and girls. This initiative
falsely assumes that the effects of past and present
discrimination no longer exist. Prop. 209 is a full retreat
in the fight against discrimination.
