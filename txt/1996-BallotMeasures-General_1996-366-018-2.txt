On election day, November 5, the citizens of Los Angeles will have the oppor-
tunity to repair our schools and make them safe by passing Proposition BB.
Proposition BB is a $2.5 billion school.repair bond that will be used exclusively
in the Los Angeles Unified School District to make the improvements needed
to meet the challenges of a new century.

Polling indicates that Proposition BB has a good chance to win. But it won't
pass unless you, your co-workers, friends, family and neighbors get involved.
Angelenos for Better Classrooms needs volunteers as well as your financial
support for voter mail, a field program and paid media. We hope you will join
our team to pass Proposition BB!
