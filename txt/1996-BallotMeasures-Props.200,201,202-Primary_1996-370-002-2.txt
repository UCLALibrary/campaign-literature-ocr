Cross-over primaries.

This cynical measure would allow Re-
publicans to vote in our Democratic
primary elections, leading to all kinds
of dirty tricks. Common Cause and the
Democratic Party urge a no vote.

Assault on mobilehome owners.
Don’t devastate senior citizen
mobilehome owners. Thousands face
loss of their mobilehomes under Prop
199. Itis opposed by AARP, the Coun-
cil of Churches and the Congress of Se-
niors.

Public education funding,
Provide first-rate learning environ-
ments for our kids. Reduce overcrowd-
ing and upgrade our schools, commu-
nity colleges and public universities for
new technologies and earthquake
safety.
