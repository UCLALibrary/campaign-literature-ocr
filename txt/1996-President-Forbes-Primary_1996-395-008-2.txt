We Need St

America needs a new vision, one tha
and freedom. We need policies that exp
releasing the vast growth potential Ic

Start with a Flat Tax
that is a tax cut.

An across the board 17% tax rate and expanded exemptions so that a family of
four would pay no taxes on the first $36,000 of income. With no taxes on
Social Security, pensions, personal savings or capital gains, this flat tax would
be fair (everyone would pay the same rate), honest (no more political manip-
ulation of the tax code) and simple — you could fill it out on a post card.

Cut spending and

reduce government.

It’s time to remove the dead weight of Washington and let the American economy
run free. Eliminate the departments of Commerce, Energy, Education and HUD.
We can also eliminate a whole alphabet soup of independent agencies.

Pass term limits.
Put an end to the permanent political class in Washington. It's the will of the
people. It makes sense. Pass term limits now.

Bring back
4's% mortgages.

Take control of our money out of the hands of politicians. Tie the value of the
dollar to a fixed measure, as we used to, and bring mortgage rates down to the
4'/% our parents took for granted.

Return control of
schools to parents.

It is time to put America’s parents back in control of our schools. Give parents
the means to educate their children in the school of their choice. Reduce the
education bureaucracy; put more resources in the classroom.
