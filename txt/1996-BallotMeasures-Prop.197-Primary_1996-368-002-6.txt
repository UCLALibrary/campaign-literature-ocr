Myths and Facts About Proposition 197
An Amendment of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1990

Proposition 197 authorizes sport hunting.

Proposition 197 authorizes the Department of Fish and Game to perform a
study of the species and propose a management plan to the Fish and Game
Commission based on the study. The Commission will then conduct public
meetings on the proposed plan and adopt all or part of it. While hunting is one
of several management options that the Commission may consider, no single
management option is suggested by Proposition 197. The proposition does,
however, require that any management tool considered be consistent with the
plan.

Mountain lions are an endangered species.

Mountain lions are not and never have been listed as threatened or
endangered by the federal or state government. However, the mountain lion
has been known to prey upon struggling species, including the endangered big
horn sheep. -

Senate Bill 28, which placed Proposition 197 on the March ballot, was sponsored by
the National Rifle Association (NRA). 3

Senator Tim Leslie (R-Tahoe City) was the sole sponsor of Senate Bill 28.
While several groups such as the California Cattlemenâ€™s Association and the
California Farm Bureau participated in strategy sessions, the NRA never
attended any such meetings regarding Senate Bill 28.

Proposition 117 banned sport hunting. ac

Proposition 117 established the mountain lion as a specially protected species,
banning the use of any proactive management techniques. While hunting was,
de facto, prohibited, the measure went well beyond banning hunting, providing
the mountain lion with more protections than those afforded to endangered
species.
