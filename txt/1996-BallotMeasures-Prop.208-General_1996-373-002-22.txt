PROPOSITION 212'S REPEAL OF THE LIMITS ON GIFTS, TRAVEL AND
SPEAKING FEES (HONORARIA) FOR PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND CANDIDATES

Questions and Answers
1. What are the current limits on gifts, speaking fees and travel with respect to public officials and candidates?

The Ethics in Government Act of 1990 currently limits the value of gifts which can be received by all elected
officials, candidates for elective office, members of state boards and commissions and key public employees. The limits are
$280 from any single source in a calendar year. (Government Code section 89503) The Act bans all honoraria, including
speaking fees and similar fees, for these public officials and candidates. (Government Code section 89502) The Act also
strictly regulates travel payments, advances and reimbursements which these individuals can receive. (Government Code
89506)

2. What does Proposition 212 do to these limits?
Proposition 212 repeals these provisions of law. (Sections 46, 47 and 48 of "Anti-Corruption Act of 1996")
3. What impact will the repeal have on the receipt of gifts, speaking fees and travel payments?

Gifts: Under Proposition 212, all public officials and candidates will be able to receive gifts, including gifts of
cash and travel, from virtually any source without limit. (Only the limits on gifts from lobbyists and lobbyist firms to some
officials and candidates would remain.)

Speaking Fees: Public officials and candidates will be permitted to receive speaking fees in any amount from any
source except for state elected officials who will still be banned by a separate provision of the State Constitution from
receiving honoraria. However, there will be no enforcement procedures or penalties for violating the Constitutional
provisions regarding honoraria if the ethics law is repealed.

Travel Payments: There will be no restrictions on receipt of travel payments, advances or reimbursements.

4. Wouldn't the repeal of these provisions allow for the circumvention of the campaign contribution limits contained
in Proposition 212?

Yes. Under Proposition 212, candidates could receive gifts of cash or speaking fees which could then be used by
the candidate to fund his or her own campaign without limitation.

5. But couldn't the Legislature pass a law to fix the problems caused by the repeal of the gift, speaking fee and travel
limits?

Maybe not. Article II, section 10(c) of the State Constitution does not permit the Legislature to amend an initiative
measure such as Proposition 212 without a vote of the people. It could take years, therefore, before the gift, speaking fees
and travel limits could be restored.
