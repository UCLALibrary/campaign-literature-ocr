DEFRAUDED LINCOLN SAVINGS AND LOAN BONDHOLDER

Dear Californians,

Charles Keating sweet-talked retired people into investing
at his Lincoln Savings and Loan.

Then he swindled us.

We took him to court. He went to jail. And eventually we
got most of our money back.

We wish this whole thing had never happened. But hiring
a lawyer was the only thing that gave us a fighting chance.

, we could not
have gotten our money back from the Keating swindle in
state court.

Under Proposition 201 “The Attorneys’ Fees Shareholder
Actions Class Actions Initiative"...you can't go to court until

Proposition 202 is just as bad. It's called "The Attorneys’
Contingent Fees Limits Initiative.”

Proposition 202 only limits Contingent Fee Attorneys...the
lawyers hired by small investors and consumers.

Support Consumers Union, the publishers of Consumer
Reports... keep your Contingent Fee Attorney Protection and
your right to take investment swindlers to court.

Vote “NO” on Propositions 201 and 202.

Sincerely,

Sam Epstein

P.S. We've added a snapshot from our Lincoln Savings picket
line. Don't let this happen again.
