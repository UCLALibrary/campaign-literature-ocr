Association of
Los Angeles
Deputy Sheriffs

Dear voters:

Dan Walker has crossed the line in his campaign for the State
Assembly. He has sent hundreds of thousands of mailers attacking
Assemblywoman Debra Bowen's record — mailers that are
absolutely untruthful.

As deputy sheriffs, we are particularly disturbed by Walker's false

accusations about Debra Bowen's crime-fighting record. Walker

falsely accused Debra of voting against the measure to open the
“Twin Towers” jail facility. The fact is that Debra Bowen supports
opening the new jail, which would prevent the release of thousands
of prisoners from overcrowded jail facilities. The official record
shows that Debra voted against the attempts to scuttle state

* funding for Twin Towers.

Dan Walker is lying about Assemblywoman Debra Bowen’s record
in an attempt to mislead voters. She is a true leader in the fight
against crime. Bowen co-wrote a bill to keep the “three strikes” law
intact after 2 court challenge and she co-wrote the law that is
adding more police and sheriffs to local communities.

That is why we are proud to be among the 60,000 police officers
and deputy sheriffs in California endorsing Debra Bowen for re-
election to the Assembly.

Please join us in voting for Debra Bowen on Tuesday, November 5.

Sincerely,

.
