DOLE KEMP

Tue DoLe/Kemp Tax PLAN

PROVIDING RELIEF TO ALEAMERTCANS:

- A 15% individual income tax rate cut for every taxpayer
- A $500-per-child family tax credit for children under 18
- Accut in the capital gains tax from 28% to 14%

- A repeal of Bill Clinton’s Social Security benefits tax

- An expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts

- Education and job training incentives

- Ending the IRS as we know it

Bob Dole will also balance the budget by the year 2002, while at the same time increasing
overall government spending by 12%. For example, Medicare spending per person will
increase at an annual rate of 6.2%. The Dole/Kemp tax cuts are entirely paid for.

In recent years, Republican Governors throughout this country have demonstrated that
balancing the budget and cutting taxes can be done at the same time.

Thus, with a pro-growth Republican Congress, balancing the budget while cutting taxes is
just a matter of presidential will. If you have it, you can do it.
Bob Dole has it. Bob Dole will do it.

Months after taking office, Bill Clinton passed the largest tax increase this world has ever
seen. Now, he says he’s unalterably opposed to cutting taxes for all Americans and has even
rejected a “no new taxes” vow if re-elected.

The Clinton economy has been sputtering along at a paltry average of 2.4%-- the slowest
growth of any recovery in the past 100 years. The economy grew at
a rate of 3.7% the quarter before Clinton took office. Moreover, real wages
have stagnated during the Clinton Administration.

Bill Clinton is obviously satisfied with the status quo. Bob Dole wants to allow Americans
to keep more of what they earn and to spend, invest, or do whatever they want with it.
