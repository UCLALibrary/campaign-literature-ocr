EDUCATION
The Republican Platform’s goal is nothing less than a renaissance in American
education, beginning with a retum of control to parents, teachers, and local school boards
and, through them, to communities and local taxpayers. The Republican Party supports:

e Policies to make parental choice among public, private and religious schools a reality
for all parents. These include charter schools and opportunity scholarships which
provide access to a quality education for all Americans.

Continuing to recognize that education should be a local — not federal ~ concern,
the Platform calls for:
¢ Prompt repeal of Clinton’s Goals 2000 and the School-to-Work Act;
© Opposition to outcome- or performance-based education in our nation’s schools.

HEALTH CARE
The goal of the Republican Party is to maintain the quality of America’s health
care while making health care and health insurance more accessible and more affordable.
The Platform expresses support for:

e Health insurance that’s portable from job to job;

e Health insurance which can not be denied because of preexisting health conditions; and

e Tax-free Medical Savings Accounts (MSA) so that individuals can plan for their own
medical needs.

ABORTION
The abortion plank of the Republican Party Platform remains pro-life. It also
reflects that ours is the party of the open door. The plank recognizes that there are.
differing views on the issue of abortion, and the principle of tolerance for those who may
disagree is expressed in diversity language included in the plank.
