LAW ENFORCEMENT SAYS:
VOTE YES ON A

LOS ANGELES COUNTY SAFE NEIG

“Fighting violent gangs is a top
priority for every local police
department in Los Angeles County.
Prop. A will help keep kids out of
trouble and off the streets by
providing at-risk youth with healthy
recreation alternatives to gangs,
drugs and graffiti. Prop. A will make
our communities safer for all of us,
and will provide safe places for our
children to play. Please join me and
local law enforcement leaders through-
out Los Angeles County in voting
YES on A — the Los Angeles County
Safe Neighborhood Parks Act.”

— Chief Steve Simonian
s County

“Keeping kids out of gangs is one of
the most important things we can do
to protect our communities. Prop. A
sets aside specific funds to prevent
gangs by repairing run-down neigh-
borhood parks that are targets for
vandalism, graffiti and crime.

- Prop. A will increase security

lighting and fencing, make parks
vandal-proof and repair broken
equipment. It’s time to reclaim our
neighborhood parks and make them
safe again for our seniors, families
and children. Please Vote YES on A
on November 5th.”’
