marijuana smoke than from an oral preparation. For the most part, however,
smoking marijuana is no more effective than taking synthetic THC by mouth.
Moreover, inhaling marijuana smoke is a health hazard; more than 400 potential
carcinogens (cancer-causing compounds) are found in the smoke. Marijuana
cigarettes obtained "on the street” may vary in effectiveness and also can be
contaminated with disease-causing agents. These agents could be particularly
harmful to patients undergoing chemotherapy. which commonly affects the immune
system's ability to fight infection.

Other antiemetic drugs oF combinations of antiemetic drugs have been shown to be
more useful than marijuana or synthetic THC as "first-line therapy” for nausea and
vomiting caused by anti-cancer drugs- Examples include a drug called ondansetron
(Zofran), used alone or combined with dexamethasone (a steroid hormone);
metoclopramide (Reglan) with diphenhydramine and dexa-methasone; high doses of
methylprednisolone (a steroid hormone} combined with droperidol (Inapsine); and
prochlorperazine (Compazine).

In general, NCI scjentists believe that synthetic THC can be useful for a limited
number of cancef patients who have chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
that cannot be controlled by other antiemetic agents. The expected side effects of
this compound must be weighed against the possible benefits.
