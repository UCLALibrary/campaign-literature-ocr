Dear Friend:

As a senior citizen, I was shocked to discover how poor a job Debra Bowen is doing
representing us in the California State Assembly.

Last May, the California Legislature voted on the Older Californians Act. This bill funded
vital services for the ill and elderly, such as home-delivered meals for those with Alzheimer’s
Disease; in-home services for seniors who need assistance with the basic tasks of daily living;
and transportation to the doctor for vital medical services or the pharmacist for drugs which
are necessary in order to survive.

Debra Bowen was the ONLY member of the State Legislature to OPPOSE the continuation
of these vital services for the elderly.

But, Debra Bowen has a long record of opposing or refusing to vote for bills important to
seniors. She also OPPOSED requiring a background check for in-home providers, and
OPPOSED extending current property tax exemptions for veterans, and REFUSED to vote on a
bill to provide increased penalties for a person who knowingly defrauds senior citizens.

Bowen even OPPOSED increasing the penalties for a person convicted of burning a
church, synagogue, temple or other place of worship... AND AGAIN, was the ONLY member
of the Assembly to do so... it passed 71-1.

IT’S TIME FOR A CHANGE.

DAN WALKER has been elected five times to the Torrance City Council. He has a proven
history of supporting programs and services for seniors.

DAN WALKER will fight for our rights and FOR the vital services that we need.
Please join with me in casting your vote for Dan Walker for Assembly... he will work for us.
Sincerely,

Lenoré Johnson
