You do have to hand it to him, however. He ran on “change”
in Washington, and then when he got to Washington, he changed his
mind. I guess for this President, that’s delivering on a promise.

That is the culture of Washington; they’ve been throwing
money around -- our money -- like it was free for decades, but they’re
afraid that if they let us keep just a little bit more, we're going to
waste it.

This is why a certain outsider has decided to run for President.
And I am here today because I want your support for this campaign.
I figured that if anyone understands start-ups, high-risk ventures
with big-growth possibilities -- it would be small business people
and entrepreneurs like you.

As you know, every venture that succeeds -- whether it’s a
new business or a Presidential campaign -- must be built on a
foundation of truth. Today, I believe that we -- that all Americans --
are looking for a way to break the stranglehold that the culture of
Washington has on the life of our nation. And we are concluding that
it will never be changed from the inside.

For example, the front-running candidate in my own party has
been spending the last year trying to portray himself as a pro-growth,
tax-cutting Republican. But in his long career as a consummate
Washington insider, he has voted to raise taxes 16 times for a total of
$962 billion in additional taxes!

One might be forgiven, when considering his current, anti-tax
stance, just how sincere this eleventh-hour campaign conversion -

really is. Did he really see the light, or did he just read the polls?
