PRO-CHOICE

ESTHER GRASSIAN,

A woman’s right to choose is constantly at risk.

Extremists like Newt Gingrich and Pat Buchanan are supporting local candidates throughout
California - intent on taking away a woman’s right.

The candidates that appear on this voter guide are 100% Pro-Choice and will fight to
protect a woman’s right to choose.

Please bring this voter guide with you to the polls on November 5th and cast your vote for choice.

Choice is a personal decision. Not Newt Gingrich’s.
