"Hundreds died or were injured in highway and bridge collapses during the Loma
Prieta and Northridge quakes alone," says Dr. Joe Penzien, Professor Emeritus,

Earthquake Engineering, UC Berkeley.

"Bridge strengthening works. Our research proves that recent advances in
engineering technology prompted by these major earthquakes will save lives, reduce

damage and preserve California’s economic vitality."

We live in one of the earth’s most active earthquake zones. We hear most about the ones
that level entire neighborhoods, collapse freeways and bridges, cause loss of life and

billions of dollars in damage.

But the truth is Californians are battered by hundreds of earthquakes and aftershocks each
year. The cumulative effect is severe, hidden deterioration threatening future loss of life and

social disruption.
