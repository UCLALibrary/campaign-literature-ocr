On May 30, 1995, Mayor Richard Riordan, Police Chief Willie Williams
and Councilman Richard Alarcon announced that General Motors had
agreed to donate 5 acres of land for the construction of a new Valley
Police Division.

This Police Division will be built only if Proposition 1 passes in the June
6 city election.

The donation of this land ensures that, if Proposition 1 passes, the new
Valley Division will be built quickly and inexpensively.

Proposition 1 will also double the size of the over-crowded West Valley
Police station.

Proposition 1 means a safer San Fernando Valley. Thatâ€™s why virtually

all Valley leaders are united in urging a strong YES vote on Proposition
1 on Tuesday, June 6.

ON PROPOSITION]

FOR A SAFER SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
