Dear Concerned Voter: wont

tp see his

Daily, over 3,000 illegal aliens cross our border,

Many come to collect welfare and other government benefits they can’t
get in their own countries, Once here, they end up crowding our
schools, jails and welfare offices — with you and | footing the bill.

I wrote Proposition 187 to put a stop to this illegal alien taxpayer
rip-off. But slick lawyers and liberal judges are standing in the way —
their lawsuits have stopped the state from implementing Prop. 187 like
you and I intended,

a coming out of his State Senate campaign,
as tough on illegal immigration — but that is simply

not true.

The Sacramento liberals and special interest groups who are
paying for the Adam Schiff mailers filling your box are the very
same liberals who opposed Prop. 187 and are continuing to block
enforcement of our English Only laws. What does that tell you?

Those of us in the State Senate who are fighting to stop the illegal aliens
taxpayer rip-off all Oppose Adam Schiff. We don’t need another liberal
lawyer in Sacramento — we have too many there already!

Don’t be fooled by Adam Schiff’s campaign distortions,

His weak record on illegal immigration speaks for itself.

Sincerely,
ae

Senator Richard Mountjoy
