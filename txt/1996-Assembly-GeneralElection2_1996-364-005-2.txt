LOCAL BUSINESSMAN, AND FIVE-TERM TORRANCE COUNCILMAN.
DAN POSSESSES BOTH THE EXPERIENCE IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND
THE TIES TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES NEEDED TO EFFECTIVELY
REPRESENT THE SOUTH BAY AREA IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY.

THE DAN WALKER RECORD

YW Dan earned a reputation on the Council as a fighter for local taxpayers.
He never voted to raise property taxes or to raise utility user taxes...
he supports cutting both.

WY Dan believes that the funding for education must be the state’s highest
priority, with the money going into the classroom, not the bureaucracy.

Dan established a proven record as a leader in providing effective
law enforcement, supporting the “‘3-strikes and you’re out” law,
swift enforcement of the death penalty, and served as South Bay
chair of the NO or Rose Bird committee.

Dan supports tort reform and effective reform of workers’
compensation laws.

WY Dan, while serving on the Los Angeles Water Quality Board,
made the clean-up of Santa Monica Bay and the protection of
our coast line a top priority. He opposes off-shore drilling.

Dan supports tough measures to protect our border from illegal entry, and
is currently the regional co-chair of the California Civil Rights Initiative
(Proposition 209), the state-wide ballot measure to ban racial quotas.
