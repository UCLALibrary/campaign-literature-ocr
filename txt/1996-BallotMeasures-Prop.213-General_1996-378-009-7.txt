Date:
File No.

The Attomey General of California has prepared the following
title and summary of the chief purpose and points of the
proposed measure:

LIMITATION ON RECOVERY TO FELONS, UNINSURED
MOTORISTS, DRUNK DRIVERS. INITIATIVE STATUTE.
Denies all recovery of damages to a convicted felon whose
injuries were proximately caused during the commission of the
felony or immediate flight therefrom. Denies recovery for
nonaconomic damages (â‚¬.g., pain, suffering, disfigurement) to
drunk drivers, if subsequently convicted, and to uninsured
motorists who were injured while cperating a vehicle. Providas
exception when an uninsured motorist is injured by a
subssquently convicted drunk driver. With this one exception,
provides that insurer is not liable for noneconomic damages.
Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of
Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments:
Reduction in these types of lawsuits could decrease court-
related costs to state and local governments and payments to
these plaintiffs. The savings would probably be minor. Possible
decrease In gross premiums tax revenue to the state through
somewhat lower premiums for liability coverage. This revenue
loss would probably be tess than $5 million annually and would
result in a corresponding reduction in state school spending of
about half of the loss.

SECTION 1, TITLE

This Measure shail be known and may be cited as The
Personal Responsibility Act of 1996.

SECTION 2, FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE

(a) Insurance costs have skyrocketed for those Califor-
nians who have taken responsibility for their actions. Uninsured
motorists, drunk drivers and criminal felons are law breakers,
and should not be rewarded for their irresponsibility and law
breaking. However, under current laws, uninsured motorists and
drunk drivers are able to recover unreasonable damages from
law abiding citizens as a result of accidents and drunk driving
accidents, and criminals have been able to recover damages
from law abiding citizens for injuries suffered during the
commission of their crimes.

(b) Californians must change the system that rewards
individuals who fail to take essential personal responsibility to
prevent them from seeking unreasonable damages or from suing
law abiding citizens.

hereby enact this measure to restore balance to our justice

uninsured motorists.
