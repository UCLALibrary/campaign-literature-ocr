“Failure of
Proposition 192 will
delay — by two to
four years — most
transportation
projects and cancel
a number of others
altogether from the
State Transportation
Improvement Plan.
If Proposition 192
passes, over

$4 billion worth of
projects can be
built over the next
three years, as
opposed to only $2
billion if it fails.”

Bob Remen
Executive Director
California Transportation Commission

The passage of Proposition 192 has major consequences for
the construction and the entire business community in our
state. After reading this information you will find that this

campaign is very winnable.

However, no statewide measure in California can pass unless it is
well financed. Contributions from business leaders like you

are critical to get our message to voters.

We have established a $2.5 million campaign budget which

we feel is reasonable and achievable.

The last page of this brochure contains information on how

to contribute to the Proposition 192 campaign.

Please make your contribution TODAY.

What Happens If Proposition 192 Does Not Pass?

The following projects face delay, cancellation or major down-sizing:

Northern Counties: 44 construction projects valued at $254,000,000

Inland Valley Counties: 80 construction projects valued at $624,000,000

Our December 12-18 poll tells us this campaign is very
winnable. With a sample size of 800 likely voters, it has an error

factor of + or - 3.5 percent.

We carefully drafted our questions to determine general support,
support after voters were provided positive arguments about the

measure, and the potential damage from opposition arguments.

Here are the critical statistics:

When asked for a vote without information,
52 percent support and 29 percent.oppose.

When provided positive information about the
measure, support increases to 70 percent
and opposition drops to 21 percent.

When provided arguments against the measure,
support stays at 62 percent PROVIDED that they
receive the positive message.

What Does The Polling Data Say About Our Chances?

“Proposition 192
will appear at the
top of the ballot.
The School Bond
Measure —
Proposition 203 —
will appear at the
end of the
statewide ballot
measures. Because
the two bond
measures are
separated by 10
other ballot
measures, the

impact on
Proposition 192
should not be

Significant.”

Proposition 192 can win in March —
but ONLY with your financial support.
