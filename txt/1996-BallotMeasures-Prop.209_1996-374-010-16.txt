‘The Constitutionality of the P. 1 California Civil Rights Initiati

The state, as a condition of contracting with private firms,
has required the firms to submit nondiscrimination
policies and employment data to the state Department of
Fair Employment and Housing. Firms are notified if
state reviews suggest their employment data do not
reflect nondiscriminatory hiring practices.

Regarding employment discrimination by government
contractors, Justice Grodin concluded: “The (C)CRI would
be invalid to the extent that it deprived a government
entity of requiring affirmative action, where otherwise
appropriate, to remedy acts of private discrimination in
which the government has become a ‘participant’ to such -
an extent that it could be held responsible for the acts of
discrimination that have occurred.”

Voluntary Affirmative Action Plans Absent Past
Discrimination

Both Professors Grodin and Varat believe that the CCRI
may constitutionally prohibit public agencies from
implementing voluntary affirmative action plans that are
not based on a record of past discrimination. For
instance, if a university's admissions policy is based on a
compelling state interest to achieve diversity in the
student body, rather than a record of past discrimination,
then the CCRI may constitutionally prohibit such a
policy.

Professor Landsberg did not directly consider the
application of voluntary affirmative action plans absent
past discrimination, although he did look at school
desegregation plans in the context of the validity, on its
face, of the ban on preferences. It was his view the CCRI
could not forbid school districts to adopt voluntary
desegregation plans, including busing plans or magnet
school plans, because to do so would directly contradict
the holding in Washington v. Seattle School District.
