Although a third of the National Education Association are Republicans and over 40% voted for Ronald
Reagan and George Bush in 1988, the union has been one of the Democratic Party’s staunchest and most
prolific supporters. Source: Forbes magazine, 6/7/93

“The NEA not only consistently urges its 2.2 million members to vote for Democratic candidates but
also gives the Democrats millions of dollars in campaign support. And perhaps most important, it
provides them with an army of campaign volunteers. . . Getting an NEA volunteer can be like getting a
free political consultant. NEA manuals depict a remarkably sophisticated training program for campaign
operatives.” The Wall Street Journal, 8/23/96

Many of the issues on which the NEA lobbies are traditional ultra-liberal agenda items that have nothing
to do with education. Among them:

¢ A single-payer national health care system
¢ “Strict” gun control laws
* Statehood for the District of Columbia

¢ The Equal Rights Amendment
