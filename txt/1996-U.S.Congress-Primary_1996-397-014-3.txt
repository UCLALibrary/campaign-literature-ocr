“Two things changed my life forever - and made me want to

work for a more just society.” a

The years that Barry appeared in “A Thousand Clowns” were among the most important of his life.
At age 14, Barry read “Profiles in Courage,” the book that President Kennedy wrote to inspire the
country. A bit after that, Barry visited the US Senate for the first time. Young Barry was fascinated

with Congress, and the tremendous responsibility they had to work for change.

Barry was so moved by these experiences that he promised himself that he would devote his life to

working for justice, to finding a way to make a difference in people’s everyday lives.

In “A Thousand Clowns,” Jason Robards tells Barry that anything is possible in life if you
set your mind to it - a belief that Barry holds to this day.
