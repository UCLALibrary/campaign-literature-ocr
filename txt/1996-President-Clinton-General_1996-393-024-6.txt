Hello, - lam and I’m calling from the (name of your union). I’d

e. Strongly supporting Bob Dole------(Go to Question #4 -- if Senate race, go to #5)

#2. Please talk to your family and friends about President Clinton. Your help is important to
winning on November 5th. (Continue with #5 if Senate race)

#3. As you know, our union has looked at the issues that effect our jobs and our families.
Based on these issues, we have endorsed the re-election of President Clinton and Vice-
President Gore.

For example, President Clinton is. pushing for a guaranteed 48-hour hospital stay for
new mothers. He vetoed drastic cuts in Medicare and Medicaid for seniors and
children. He signed the Family and Medical Leave Act. He increased funding for
breast cancer research. And, he fought for health insurance benefits which workers
can take with them when changing jobs.

Also, the President has fought to put middle-class and working Americans first. He
led the fight for an increased minimum wage. Under President Clinton, mortgage
rates are low. The unemployment rate has steadily declined.

Please consider these and other issues before voting on November 5th. (Continue with
#5 if Senate race)

#4, Thanks for your time. Goodbye.
#5. As you know, there is also an election for the U.S. Senate this November. If the election

were held today, who would you support? (Record response)
Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. Good night.
