THE CURRENT MINIMUM WAGE GUARANTEES POVERTY
IN 1996, THE BUYING POWER OF THE MINIMUM WAGE REACHED A 40-YEAR LOW.

A full-time minimum wage worker’s income is 25% below the poverty line for a family of three
The value of California’s minimum wage dropped 14% in eight years.

SINCE 1988, SALARIES FOR CORPORATE EXECUTIVES DOUBLED,
CORPORATE PROFITS SKYROCKETED, BUT MINIMUM WAGE WCRKERS
HAVE FALLEN FURTHER INTO POVERTY.

At $4.75 an hour, the new federal minimum wage leaves
a California family of three $3,100 a year below the poverty line.

PROP. 210 RESTORES THE VALUE OF THE MINIMUM WAGE BY RAISING IT
IN TWO STEPS TO $5.75 AN HOUR BY 1998.

WHO BENEFITS FROM PROP. 210?
2.1 MILLION CALIFORNIANS WORK AT LOW-WAGE JOBS.

THEY DO SOME OF THE HARDEST, DIRTIEST AND MOST IMPORTANT WORK.
MOST WORK FOR PROFIT-MAKING BUSINESSES.

More than a million are women; 80% are adults. 175,000 care for elderly and disabled Californians.
They are concentrated in retail, agriculture, hotel, restaurant, and service jobs.

Prop. 210 benefits 800,000 low wage California workers who
get nothing from the new federal minimum wage.

California has a higher cost of living than states like Mississippi. A federal minimum wage that is even
: below the poverty line in Mississippi is much too low for California.

MORE THAN 700,000 CALIFORNIA MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS
ARE THE MAIN OR SOLE SUPPORT FOR THEIR FAMILIES

PROP. 210 WILL RAISE THE PAY OF THESE HARDWORKING CALIFORNIANS.
