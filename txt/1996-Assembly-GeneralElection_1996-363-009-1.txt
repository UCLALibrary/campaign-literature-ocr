SIERRA CLUB

Dear Voter,

I am writing to set the record straight about Dan Walker’s slick smear campaign against
Assemblywoman Debra Bowen.

Torrance Councilman Dan Walker is simply not being truthful about Debra’s record -- nor his own
record.

Despite his claims, he has not taken a leading role in protecting the environment during his 17-year
political career. In fact, his largest contributors are polluters who try to use their cozy relationships
with politicians to avoid cleaning up their own messes.

How can we trust a man like Dan Walker, who uses his power to help his contributors like Western
Waste, a trash hauling company convicted of bribery and corruption? We can’t.

The Sierra Club enthusiastically supports Assemblywoman Debra Bowen for re-election. She is
clearly one of our state’s leaders in protecting our coastline as a natural, recreational and economic
resource.

More than anybody else, Assemblywoman Debra Bowen fights against the special interests who are
trying to gut basic environmental protections. Debra helped pass legislation to ban off-shore oil
drilling, and led the battle against the chemical industry’s efforts to weaken the Safe Drinking Water
Act and the Birth Defects Prevention Act.

We cannot afford to elect people like Dan Walker. We need proven leaders like Debra Bowen in the
Assembly to protect our environment. Please join us in supporting her on election day.

Sincerely,

Mee emacs
