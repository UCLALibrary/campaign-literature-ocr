REDEVELOPMENT = COMMUNITY
IMPROVEMENT AND VITALITY

Some of California’s most successful community
revitalization projects were funded through redevel-
opment agencies. A few examples: Old Town
Pasadena, Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica,
Bunker Hill in downtown Los Angeles, Horton Plaza
in San Diego, Yerba Buena in San Francisco and Old
Town Sacramento. Other redevelopment projects
recently approved include earthquake repair

projects in the San Fernando Valley and neighbor-
hood revitalization in Oakland and inner-city Los
Angeles. If Proposition 217 had existed at the time
these projects were on the table, they could have
been jeopardized or non-existent.

community redevelopment funds must go to
provide affordable housing. With passage of
Proposition 217, there could be fewer affordable
houses constructed and fewer opportunities for
those Californians struggling to buy a home.

WHEN COMMUNITIES CANNOT GROW AND IMPROVE, JOBS ARE LOST

Redevelopment agencies also create and preserve jobs. A biotechnology facility expan-

company from accepting out-of-state offers and preserving 1,000 jobs in California. A
