I. Introduction

In California, approximately 375,000 mobilehomes are located on rented spaces within
mobilehome parks.' The majority of these "mobilehomes” are "doublewide” (two sections
attached at the site). Their average size is roughly 1,000 square feet.? The majority of the
residents of mobilehome parks are over 55 years old.?

Approximately 89 California jurisdictions, containing approximately 130,000 mobilehome
spaces, have rent control laws. These laws do not apply to mobilehome spaces which are subject
to leases with a form. of more than 12 months. Any such space is exempted by state law from
local regulation.‘ However, when the long term lease expires, the mobilehome owners has the
option of executing new leases or coming under the coverage of the local rent control ordinance.

Mobilehome owners view rent regulation as critical to the protection of their interests. The
justifications commonly set forth for mobilehome rent ordinances are that:

- mobilehome owners have invested substantial sums to purchase their
mobilehomes;

- the cost of moving "mobile" homes and setting them up is substantial;*

55 or over. California Department of Housing and Community Development, Mobilehome Parks in California,
pp.22 & 30 (1986).

‘ There is no systematic data on the proportion of spaces which are under long term exempt leases. In some
jurisdictions a substantial portion of all units are exempt.
