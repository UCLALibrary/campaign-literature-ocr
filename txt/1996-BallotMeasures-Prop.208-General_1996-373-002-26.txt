Relationship to Other Measures

This measure provides that if both this measure and
another measure or measures relating to campaign
finance reform on this ballot are approved by the voters,
the measures will be considered to be in conflict. If this
measure is approved with the most votes, then this
measure will take effect in its entirety and none of the
provisions of the other measure or measures will take
effect. If the other measure or measures are approved
with the most votes, the provisions of this measure that
are not in conflict will take effect.

revenues to the state and local governments.

and enforcement of its provisions. Based on information
provided by the FPPC and the Secretary of State, we
estimate that the costs would be up to $4 million
annually. To offset the FPPCâ€™s enforcement costs, the
measure includes an annual General Fund
appropriation, based on a formula, which in 1996-97
would be approximately $570,000. The measure provides
that the annual appropriation be adjusted in future years
for inflation.

In addition, the measure would result in additional
state and local election costs to provide additional
information on candidates in voter pamphlets. These
costs are unknown, but are probably not significant.

Revenues. Elimination of tax deductions for lobbying
expenses would result in additional tax revenues to the
state of about $6 million annually.
