with GPR,

the California Political
Reform Initiative

The problem:

big money turns elections
into auctions, with the
highest bidders buying
access and influence.

The result: our elected
Officials serve special
interests, not the public
good.

“Legislature for Sale"

San Jose Mercury-News

“our absolute
best chance to
clean up politics."

— Fran Packard, President,
League of Women Voters
of California

The solution:

a tough campaign finance
reform initiative from the
broadest citizens’ reform
coalition ever.

When passed by the
voters, the CPR Act will
be the strictest such law
in the nation.

The sponsors:
League of Women Voters
Common Cause
American Association of

Retired Persons (AARP)
United We Stand

Why is it that...

.... While most voters want consumer and
environmental protection, good schools,
and efficient government, that's not what
we get from our elected officials? .

Special interests like oil and chemical
companies, insurance and pharma-
ceutical interests, tobacco and alcohol,
poison the election process with massive
contributions which buy them excessive
influence.

What the CPR
initiative does:

® bans lobbyists from making or
arranging political contributions

® strictly limits donations to state and
local elected officials & candidates

® bans campaign war chests and non-
election-year fund-raising

® provides incentives for limiting
campaign spending

@ increases enforcement & penalties for
Fair Political Practices violations

® requires disclosure of who's behind
campaigns
