Bic SPECIAL INTEREST Money IS CORRUPTING ADAM
SSCHIFF’S CAMPAIGN FOR STATE SENATE

That’s the agenda of the special
interests who are paying for Adam Schiff’s
campaign for State Senate.

Hundreds of thousands of dollars are
being funneled into Schiff’s campaign from
the fat cat lobbyists who represent lawyers

and labor unions in Sacramento.

Hundreds of thousands more from
liberal politicians who need Schiff’s vote to

preserve their power.

According to the California Public
Interest Research Group — a non-partisan
organization — 94 percent of Schiff’s
campaign money has come from outside

our area.

Only 6 percent comes from local
people who Schiff claims he will represent
if he is elected.

This isn’t the first time Adam Schiff has
reached far and low to pay for his campaign.
When he ran against our Assemblyman
James Rogan two years ago, Schiff took
thousands of dollars from ultra-liberal
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown.

Now Brown’s gone from the
Legislature, so Schiff is taking hundreds
of thousands of dollars from another
San Francisco area liberal — Senator
Bill Lockyer.

Schiff says that’s just how politics
works. Schiff says we shouldn’t worry

about who’s paying for his campaign.

The lawyers, labor unions and liberal
politicians aren’t worrying either, because
they know the number one rule of politics
in Sacramento:

You get
what you pay for.

66 Too many politicians say one

thing, then do something else.

Why? Because they serve the
special interests and people
who give them big campaign
contributions, not the voters

back home in their district. 9?
