Under Prop. 217, about half of
the $860 million in the first year
and $700 million in each following
year will be returned to California's
schools. The amounts are
determined by school funding
formulas under Prop. 98. This
means that for 1996-97, roughly
$350 million will go to 30-student
classrooms in the following
estimated amounts:

Elementary $2,340
High School $2,850
Unified (K-12) $2,460

In 1997-98 and thereafter,
estimated amounts are:

Elementary $1,650
High School $1,980
Unified (K-12) $1,710

Parents, teachers and local
school boards are backing Prop.
217 as a crucial investment in the
vitality of our state’s schools.

“Prop. 217 provides about $2,500 for
each California classroom and
returns revenues to communities for
local services like libraries and
parks that kids rely on. For
educators, parents and others with a
stake in our school children’s future,

the choice on Prop. 217 is

elementary: yes.”

“California schools are making a giant
effort to reduce class size. We must
support efforts to provide our
children with an excellent foundation
as they begin their school lives.
Prop. 217 ensures that about $350

million will go to schools instead of

to the wealthy in a tax cut.”

“Prop. 217 is good common sense.
We need the resources to help our
state's schools and students
perform to the best of their ability,
and Prop. 217 sensibly provides
needed revenues without raising

anyone's taxes.”
