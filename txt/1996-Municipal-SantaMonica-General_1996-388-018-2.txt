¢ For her past four years on the
council, this gang/drug
prosecutor has led the struggle
to prohibit aggressive
panhandling and change our
city's free-for-all homeless
policy

¢ Voted to put more police
officers on the street and for a
youth curfew to control gangs

Enforce Santa Monica's
important Public Safety and
Homeless Services Act: This law
bans aggressive panhandling and
camping in our parks. It also
requires the city to hold both
providers and recipients of
homeless services accountable for
the desired result: getting people
off the streets and helping them
become self-sufficient.

¢ As a Santa Monica Recreation
and Parks Commissioner,
fought to make our parks safer
by adding park rangers,
prohibiting encampments, and
creating a citizens' Park Watch

¢ Worked with the Santa Monica
police to reduce crime on our
beach

Give the police the tools they
need to suppress violent crime:
Attract federal funding for gang
intervention programs. Obtain and
enforce restraining orders that

make it harder for gangs to operate.

Provide police with resources to
enforce tough new state laws
aimed at stopping drug dealing and
prostitution.

¢ Organized a Neighborhood
Watch to fight drug dealing,
graffiti, home break-ins, and
prostitution in her Ocean Park
neighborhood

¢ Works with programs that get
homeless teens off the streets
and into treatment and
counseling to break the cycle
of homelessness

Make Santa Monica's public
places and public transit safer for
our youth: Make restrooms in our
parks safer. Ensure that the juvenile
curfew is enforced. Cooperate with
the school board to make our
schools safer and explore the
enactment of a local truancy law.
Increase city bus drivers' awareness
of their young riders' safety.
