Bob Dole vs. The Facts

Rather than offering a clear vision for the future, Bob Dole offered harsh attacks and a distorted
picture of President Clinton’s record. Here’s a partial list of the exaggerated claims and
misstatements he made during the debate this evening:

ATTACK: “J look at the slowest growth in a century.”

THE FACTS: Under President Clinton, the private sector of the economy has grown 3.2 percent
per year -- and that’s a stronger record of private-sector growth than either the Reagan (3.0%) or
Bush (1.3%) Administrations. [Based on data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis] The
conservative business magazine Barron’s concluded that President Clinton had a stronger
economic record than any Republican Administration in the post-World War Ii era. And just 8
months ago, Bob Dole himself said that “It is also true, as some have said, that our economy is
the strongest it’s been in 30 years.” [Bob Dole Remarks to the New Hampshire Legislature,
2/13/96]

ATTACK: “Don’t forget what happened in 1993...a tax on everybody in America.”

THE FACTS: H&R Block confirms that the President’s plan increased income tax rates only
for the top 1.2 percent, while cutting taxes for "16.6% of all taxpayers [who] benefit from the
Earned Income Tax Credit Expansion." [H&R Block Analysis, August 1993.] And the 1993 4-
cent gas tax cost families only $3 a month -- all going towards cutting the deficit by sixty
percent. But look at Dole’s record. During his 35 years in Washington, Dole hiked 450
different taxes and fees -- at least $900 billion to $2 trillion in higher taxes. [CQ Almanac, 1960-
1992] Dole increased Social Security taxes, unemployment taxes, taxes and fees on Medicare,
telephone taxes, gas taxes, automobile taxes, airline taxes, beer taxes, boat taxes, and vacation
fees. [1982 CO Almanac, p. 31-32; p. 55-S, Vote # 337; 1990 CO Almanac, p. 63-S, Vote # 326;
1983 COQ Almanac, p. 219; p. 12-S, Vote # 54; 199] CQ Almanac, p. 308; p. 33-S, Vote # 254]

CLAIM: “1 doubt that I acknowledged that [best economy in 30 years] this year.”

THE FACTS: “It is also true, as some have said, that our economy is the strongest it’s been in
30 years.” [Dole Remarks before the New Hampshire State Legislature, 2/13/96]

ATTACK: “You pay...more than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes
under this administration.”
