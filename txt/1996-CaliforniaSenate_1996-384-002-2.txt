A Dream of California

answers. The hand of the past closes the ability to
hear the call of the future. California has changed,

] ee rhetoric today mostly consists of repeating old.

For the past 40 years California was fattened by Cold War
contracts. We still are enjoying schools, universities and
freeways built in the 1950s. We were a state of less than
twenty million in the 1960s. Energy was cheap, the
environment seemingly boundless, so we built suburbs miles
and miles from our work. The population and workforce
was largely white and European. Our economy, the 7th
largest in the world, was a powerhouse supplying weapons,
computers and movies to far-flung places and cultures.

-We were the culminating expression of the frontier
personality, conquering all external obstacles to our
expansion. If we were accused of tinseled escapism, of
running away from our internal needs, we compensated by
discovering new frontiers. Masters of our destiny, envy of
the world, we were the future.

It takes no scholarship, only a cup of coffee, to see that
life has changed in California.
