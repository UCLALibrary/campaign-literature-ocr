Bill Clinton’s War on Small Business

Small businesses are the driving force in our economy. Today
they are more important than ever. America’s small businesses
are the engine of job creation. Small firms employ almost half
of America’s workers.

The last thing the government should do is hit those small
entrepreneurs with more taxes and regulations than they face
already. But that's exactly what Bill Clinton is doing. In just
four years he has launched a full-scale assault on small
business:

+ Signed the Largest Tax Increase in History. Bill Clinton's 1993
tax increase — the largest in history — forced millions of small
businesses to pay at a new and higher top income tax rate of
39.6 percent. In fact, more than two-thirds of the people who
pay President Clinton's new top tax rate are America’s small
business owners.

* Opposed Regulatory Reform. President Clinton threatened
to veto legislation that brought sensible risk assessment and
cost-benefit measures to new regulations.

A Dole-Kemp Administration Will
Let Small Businesses Flourish

The Dole-Kemp economic growth plan will reduce the tax
liabilities of 19.2 million small businesses by 15 percent. In
addition, the Dole-Kemp plan will:

+ Increase the estate tax exemption for businesses so that
family-owned businesses can stay in the family.

* Cut the capital gains tax rate by 50 percent, which will help
business owners and also unleash capital that will be invested
in new and rising small businesses.

+ Restore a meaningful home office tax deduction to provide
relief to the growing number of home-based small businesses.

+ Reform the independent contractor and employee
classification rule to make the rules clear, simple, and objective
— so that small businesses can easily determine up-front if
their new hire is an employee or an independent contractor.

* Increase the tax deduction for health i insurance | costs for self-
