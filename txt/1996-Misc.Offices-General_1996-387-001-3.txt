WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT CANDIDATE FALLS?

TO THE VOTERS IN CITRUS COURT:

As a conservative ...and as head of an anti-tax organization, | supported

the recall of Covina council members who passed a utility tax for the city
without a vote of its citizens. The recall was a success and Thomas Falls

won a seat on the council. Falls became a power on the City Council and

was part of the leadership that passed a new utility tax that was twice as
costly.

What kind of judge would he make? | don’t want the risk. That’s why | am
supporting Nida Alex for judge.

HE'S FAST AND

LOOSE
WITH THE TRUTH

5000+ VOTERS WANTED FALLS
RECALLED FROM THE COVINA
COUNCIL. HE FOUND A LEGAL
LOOPHOLE AND SAVED HIMSELF.

FALLS ONCE AGAIN BOTCHED IT—

SHOT OFF HIS MOUTH—AND A 14-YEAR-
OLD BOY WAS MURDERED...

Falls, who claims to be a veteran deputy District Attorney asked the father that
his 14 year old boy testify in a gang murder case. The father, of course, was
concerned about the safety of his son. According to a witness, Falls assured him
that he “had never heard of, nor had knowledge of, any non-gang member
witness to a gang crime (being) injured or killed for testifying.” Since the 14
year old boy did not belong to a gang, the boy testified at a preliminary hear-
ing, believing that he was not in any danger and had nothing to worry about.
On the eve of the trial the 14 year old boy was shot to death near his home.
Falls, of course, came out great in the ensuing lawsuit for the death of the boy.

The 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled that prosecutors had immunity.
Falls once again lucked out.

FALLS CLAIMED TO HAVE THE
ENDORSEMENT OF “ALL THE JUDGES
ON THE CITRUS COURT.”

IT WASN’T TRUE.
THE COURT STATED:

We will leave it to the other courts to comment on Falls’ claims as it relates to
them, but we wish to point out that of the seven judges of the Citrus Municipal

Court, only one has taken an official position in the contested race by
endorsing Falls.

BECAUSE IT’S ALL
ABOUT HONESTY...

For Judge - Citrus Court
