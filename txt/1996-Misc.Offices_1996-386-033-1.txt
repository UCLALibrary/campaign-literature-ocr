VOTE FOR A HUMANE CALIFORNIA
NOVEMBER 5,1996

Election coverage is often so focused on the presidential election, that we learn little about
candidates in local elections. Below is a slate of honest, capable, candidates who have
demonstrated a concern for the needs of our communities, the environment, and the
creatures with which we share them. Please take a moment to review your voting

choices and consider supporting these concerned and compassionate candidates.
