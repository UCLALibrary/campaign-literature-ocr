“We’re Tired of SMRR Scare Tactics.”

| Ty | In every city council campaign, SMRR warns tenants
} we'll all be thrown out of our homes unless their
candidates are elected. We're tired of being
manipulated like that. We know our rent control is
protected by the city charter, which can only be
| changed by the voters.

)) This year there’s a new scare tactic: Our landlords will
harass us and throw us out of our homes, because a
new state law allows rent increases for new tenants.
Let’s face it—there are laws to stop such landlords. If
SMRR is the great protector of tenants, why didn’t they
stop this bill from being passed in the first place?

We've been renters in Santa Monica for 36 years, and

we definitely don’t need a political machine to tell us
how to vote. Anyway, what has SMRR done for us lately? Its handpicked council
members turned Santa Monica into a magnet for transients and drug dealers.

For Santa Monica City Council, we're voting for Asha Greenberg, Frank Schwengel,
and Shari Davis—because they will truly represent our interests.
