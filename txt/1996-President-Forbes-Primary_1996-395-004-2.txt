Steve Forbes offers Republican voters a clear choice in the presidential primaries.
“Tf the Washington politicians were really going to change Washington, it would have
happened already,” Forbes stated. “They won’t, but we can.”

Mr. Forbes proposes scrapping the tax code and starting over with a low, fair,
simple flat tax of 17%. “Taxes are a big, big business. The Washington politicians create
complex regulations and loopholes for lobbyists and special interests, trading favors for
political support. So take away the tax code and you take away the power of the
Washington politicians. Scrap the tax code and replace it with a low, flat tax. It’s simple.
It’s honest. And that’s a big change for Washington.”

Mr. Forbes believes that this and other pro-growth, pro-opportunity changes will
enable America to expand not only with an extraordinary rise in our standard of living,
but also to dramatically improve our quality of life.
