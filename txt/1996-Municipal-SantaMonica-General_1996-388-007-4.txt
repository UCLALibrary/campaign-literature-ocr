SMRR

Our schools are our future.

Most cities assume that education is the sole responsibility of

the school district, and they don’t get involved in efforts to
improve their schools. Not Santa Monica.

SMRR realizes that outstanding schools are everyone’s

responsibility - and are an essential element in the quality of
life for the entire community.

When Santa Monica schools faced drastic state and federal
education cutbacks, SMRR-supported City Councilmembers
P stepped up to the plate. SMRR

million a year in funds to help
support and improve Santa

programs - the kinds of things that that make the

difference between a good school and a great school
system.

SMRR has also worked to pass school bonds in the City that
i have nearly completely renovated our aging school buildings
and facilities.

SMRR has also been in the forefront of efforts to improve

and expand the availability of quality affordable child care in
the city.
