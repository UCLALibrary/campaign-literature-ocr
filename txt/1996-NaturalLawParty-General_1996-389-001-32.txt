GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED BY NATURAL LAW

well-being is practice of the TM-Sidhi program®
by groups together in one location. The TM-
Sidhi program is an advanced meditation pro-
gram to release stress [18], which leads to im-
proved cognitive ability [19], intelligence [20],
moral development [21], cardiovascular health
[22], and biochemical markers of aging [23], as
well as higher levels of psychophysiological in-
tegration, shown by improved perceptual-mo-
tor performance [24].

The TM-Sidhi program includes the technique
of “Yogic Flying” [25]. Research has found that
EEG brain wave coherence increases dramati-
cally during TM-Sidhi Yogic Flying [26], accom-
panied by the subjective experience of deep hap-
piness and exhilaration.

The TM-Sidhi program is not, however, prac-
ticed solely for its beneficial effects on the indi-
vidual. Its chief purpose is to produce profoundly
positive effects in collective consciousness.
When groups practice the TM-Sidhi program
together, they powerfully enliven the deepest
level of natural law throughout the whole popu-
lation. The most significant research findings on
this program indicate that such groups dissolve
social stress and create a society-wide influence
of increased social order and coherence.

Forty-two scientific studies have shown that such
coherence-creating groups (comprising as little
as the square root of 1% of the population) pro-
mote highly significant decreases in violent
crime and other negative tendencies, and in-
creases in positive social and economic trends.
Each such study has produced consistent, statis-
tically significant results. Nearly half have been
reported in peer-reviewed journals [27].

A growing number of scientists support this re-
search, in recognition of its rigor, scope, and sta-
tistical significance. According to a member of
the independent Project Review Board that
monitored the 1993 Washington study, “the
claim can be made plausibly that the promised
practical societal impact of this research signifi-

60

cantly exceeds that of any other ongoing social-
psychological research program” [28].

3. Government itself should function with the
efficiency and effectiveness of nature’s govern-
ment.

The Natural Law Party promotes a new defini-
tion of government: Government should be able
to prevent problems. A government without the
ability to prevent problems is not a sovereign
government. It becomes crisis driven, a victim
of situations and circumstances. Moreover, such
a government itself becomes an unwieldy and
costly problem for the nation.

To fulfill its highest goals, every government
should immediately create and maintain a group
professionally engaged in creating coherence
throughout society. Establishing these groups at
the local, state, and federal levels would quietly
bring the support of natural law to national law;
solve problems at their basis in individual and
collective consciousness; and promote the high-
est level of efficiency in governmental adminis-
tration [29].

4. The Natural Law Party supports the estab-
lishment of a “prevention wing” in the military—
a group whose primary purpose is to prevent the
outbreak of war and to preserve and strengthen
national and international peace. This can be ac-
complished with as few as 1-2% of military per-
sonnel, comprising one or several groups of
5,000-10,000 experts trained in the TM-Sidhi
program. As well as “inoculating” participating
troops against the debilitating effects of combat
stress, this program would help relieve stress in
the nation as a whole, prevent incoherence within
the government, and protect the nation from
negative influences both inside and outside the
country—including terrorism and war.

This is a practical, highly cost-effective, funda-
mental solution to our nation’s problems—one
that will bring both immediate and long-term
results. As the government runs out of funds,

GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED BY NATURAL LAW

our federal officials have been wrangling over
short-term, essentially reactive solutions. But
without bringing national law in tune with natu-
ral law, no legislative initiatives will ever suc-
ceed in eliminating social and economic prob-
lems and developing a strong moral core at the
heart of our nation. For this reason, the Natural
Law Party supports the use of programs to re-
duce societal stress and bring national life into
accord with natural law.
