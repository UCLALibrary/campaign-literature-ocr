PATRICK J. BUCHANAN

Dear Friend,

Do you want the Republican Party to take a strong stand
against illegal immigration in 1996?

If so, I hope you’1ll take a moment today to fill out the
enclosed Republican Referendum on Illegal Immigration.

Your Referendum asks very basic questions that are at the
heart of the growing national debate on illegal immigration,
among them:

* Should we stop forcing taxpayers to fund
welfare and health care for illegal aliens?

* Should we increase the Border Patrol to stop
illegal aliens from flooding our Southern border?

* Should the Republican Party platform endorse
a national version of California’s Proposition 187
which cuts off welfare benefits for illegal aliens?

My friend, it’s time for you to get involved in the battle
over illegal immigration because the presidential candidates have
radically different views about the solutions to our nation’s
immigration crisis.

I’m planning to take results of this Referendum around to key
primary states to show the state Republican Party chairmen and
the other Presidential candidates where the American people stand
on this critical issue.

It’s no secret where I stand.

I believe the explosion in illegal immigration is causing
massive crime, social disruption and an enormous financial drain
on government services.

A few brief facts about illegal immigration’s impact on what
many Americans see as our greatest social problem, crime:

* Almost a quarter of the criminals in federal prisons are
now illegal aliens.
