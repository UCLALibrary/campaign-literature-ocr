SECTION 4. ASSESSMENT AND PROPERTY RELATED FEE REFORM.

Article XIIID of the California Constitution is hereby added:

SEC. 1. Application.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the provisions of this Article shall
apply to all assessments, fees and charges whether imposed pursuant to state
statute or local government charter authority. Nothing in this Article or Article
XIIIC shall be construed to:

(a) provide any new authority to any agency to impose a tax,
assessment, fee or charge;

(b) affect existing laws relating to the imposition of fees or charges
as a condition of property development;

[Annotation: the purpose of this provision is to leave unaffected any existing law
relating to developer fees. Although there have been abuses in this area by local
governments (resulting in substantially increased housing costs), the focus of
Proposition 218 is on those levies imposed simply by virtue of property ownership.
Developer fees, in contrast, are imposed as an incident of the voluntary act of
development. Moreover, neither this section nor other provisions of Proposition 218
would impair the ability of developers to employ ‘land secured financing” as a means
to finance infrastructure.] or;

(c) affect existing laws relating to the imposition of timber yield
taxes.

[These taxes are already addressed in the California Constitution and by legislation.
The intent of Proposition 218 was to leave this entire area of law unaffected.]
