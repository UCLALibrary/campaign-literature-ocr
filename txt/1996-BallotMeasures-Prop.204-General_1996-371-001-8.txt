ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 204
Safe drinking water is something most of us take for granted. But the truth is, unless we
act now, California's residents, businesses and farms face a future of chronic water
shortages and potentially unsafe supplies. According to the California Department of
Water Resources, our water problems will only get worse, due to increasing population
and a water supply system that has not kept up with our needs.

Proposition 204, the SAFE, CLEAN, RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY ACT, provides the foundation
for a comprehensive and lasting solution to the state’s water supply needs. Proposition
204 is a truly BALANCED WATER SOLUTION THAT IS GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY AND JOBS,
GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT AND GOOD FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS.

PROPOSITION 204 WILL BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS BY:

ENSURING SAFE DRINKING WATER. Proposition 204 helps meet safe drinking water
standards to protect public health.

INCREASING WATER SUPPLIES. Proposition 204 makes more water available to meet the
state's growing needs through conservation, recycling and potential off-stream
reservoirs and delivery systems to capture water in wet years for use during droughts.

PREVENTING WATER POLLUTION. Our streams, rivers, lakes, bays and coastal waters are
threatened by pollution. Proposition 204 provides for cleanup of our precious
waterways.

PROTECTING AGAINST FLOODS. Flooding threatens lives and has caused billions of
dollars in property damage. Proposition 204 allows long-overdue flood protection
projects to be completed. “

HELPING OUR ECONOMY AND JOBS. Water is the lifeblood of California's economy.
Reliable water supplies will protect existing jobs, encourage new businesses and create
new jobs.

ENCOURAGING WATER CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING. Proposition 204 ensures we
get the most out of our existing water supplies by encouraging conservation and
recycling.

PROTECTING FISH AND WILDLIFE. Proposition 204 helps protect critical fisheries, wildlife,
wetlands and other natural habitats, including the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta. The Bay-Delta is one of the state’s most important environmental
resources and the source of drinking water for over 22 million Californians.

PROTECTING AGAINST EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE. Seismic experts believe our water
delivery system is in danger from major earthquakes, which could leave residents,
businesses and farms without water. Proposition 204 provides necessary repairs and
improvements to the delivery system to help prevent catastrophic failures.
