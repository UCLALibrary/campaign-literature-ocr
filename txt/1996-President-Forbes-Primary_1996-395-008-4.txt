AEFORBES FOR PRESIDENT

Hon@nes POR PRESIDENT

We're leading a national crusade to change America
— to take our government back from politicians and
return it to the people.

I believe in America’s future of growth, hope and
opportunity. We want a balanced budget — that’s a tax
cut. We want a simple honest flat tax. And we want to
end wasteful government spending.

Join our crusade by casting your vote for me and
send the politicians ‘a message.
