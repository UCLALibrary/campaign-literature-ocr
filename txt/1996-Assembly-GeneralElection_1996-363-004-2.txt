That's why Assemblywoman Debra Bowen is working with
law enforcement to take guns out of the hands of criminals.

Drive-by shootings. Gang wars. Armed robberies.
Guns do kill people — 103 a day. That outrages
Debra Bowen. So she has courageously taken on
the powerful Radical Gun Lobby to pass sensible
gun laws and rid our streets of fear and violence.
That’s a pretty good reason for re-electing Debra
Bowen. But if that’s not enough, here are 10 more:

1. Bowen supports the assault weapons ban.

2. Bowen works with law enforcement to ban
Saturday Night Specials and make it a felony
to carry a concealed handgun - just as it is a
felony to carry a switch blade.

3. Bowen supports limiting the number of bullets
held by a rapid-fire gun.

4. Bowen works with our local police chiefs to allow
cities to pass their own gun control laws.
