For almost two decades, SMRR has

worked for the issues we care about.

Over the past decade, Santa Monica has become one of the
most desirable places in Southern California to live. Well, it
didn’t happen by accident — it happened because of SMRR’s

leadership on the City Council.

SMRR has helped drive crime down to a 20 year low. SMRR
Council members added 63 police —- a 50% increase in the force
— initiated community-based policing, and passed ordinances

that have discouraged panhandling and camping in parks.

SMRR has made Santa Monica a great place to raise a family.
SMRR Council members spearheaded efforts to restore the
Santa Monica Pier, start innovative day care programs and
rescued our schools from federal and state cutbacks. Santa
Monica’s world-class arts center, exceptional senior services,

and model environmental program are all the thanks to SMRR.

SMRR has built a thriving local economy. Through the sound,
innovative entrepreneurial policies of SMRR Councilmembers,
our city has a AAA municipal bond rating — the highest of any

city in the state!

On November 5th, help keep the tradition of innovative, effective
leadership alive. Vote SMRR for City Council — vote Feinstein,

Olsen and Genser.
