not. We have an enormous investment in our highway system. Retrofitting bridges and
overpasses to withstand earthquakes costs one-tenth as much as rebuilding them after they

All of California's taxpayer's will be hit with massive tax increases because rebuilding our
earthquake-destroyed highway system will cost billions more than strengthening those
structures right now.

In addition, disruptions to California’s economy will drive up prices and cost jobs for everyone
in the aftermath of a major earthquake. ‘
