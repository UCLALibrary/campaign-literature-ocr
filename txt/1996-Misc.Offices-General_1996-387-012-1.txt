“County leaders must persevere to protect

resources lest we fall victim to the
problems of Orange County and the San
Fernando Valley. As your full-time advocate
on the Ventura County Board of Super-

LIFE we so enjoy. Serious budget problems
face the County and my 16 years as
councilman/mayor provide me with the
experience to face these challenges.”
