A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM BoB DOLE

Dear Friend:
America needs leadership.
To be a great President requires unique qualities of character,

experience and leadership. In my life, I've been tested in many
ways and have always found strength in the values that made this

country grea

h in God, belief in community, personal respon-
sibility and love of family.

Our country must again have leaders who believe in our people
and are proud of our values. We need leaders who will summon
from each of us the best of our character, who will call us as a
nation to our full potential. I want to be President so I can do this
for America.

My mandate as President-would be to rein in the Federal govern-
ment in order to set free the spirit of the American people; to
reconnect our government in Washington with the common sense

values of our citizens; and to reassert American interests wherever

and whenever they are challenged around the world. Today I stand
ready to lead an American renewal of hope, prosperity and pride.

I hope you will join this campaign for our future. If you are
already a supporter, Elizabeth and I appreciate your commitment.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Bob Dole
