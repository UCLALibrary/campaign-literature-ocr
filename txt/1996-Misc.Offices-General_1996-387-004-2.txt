Santa Monica is living
on borrowed time.

In 1994, the Northridge quake caused widespread destruction
in our community. In the next emergency — whether it’s a quake,
a mgjor fire or even a terrorist action — it could be worse.

“‘We survived the earthquake without loss
of life because of a lot of luck and the
commitment of our fine police, fire and
paramedic personnel. We may not be so
lucky next time.’’

— Santa Monica Police Chief
James Butts

The city’s antiquated police headquarters is
simply inadequate to meet Santa Monica’s
public safety needs in everyday situations — let
alone during a major emergency.

In the immediate aftermath of the Northridge
earthquake, Santa Monica’s 911 system went
down and stayed down for more than an hour.
And — for more than four hours — our public
safety personnel were forced to coordinate their
emergency response efforts out of a van
confiscated by police during a drug bust. All
because Santa Monica has no dedicated
Emergency Operations Center (EOC).

More than two years after the Northridge

quake, the city of Santa Monica still does not
have a dedicated EOC. The current police
facility — old and a danger to public safety —
simply cannot accommodate an Emergency
Operations Center.

“The safety facility is necessary to ensure
that in the event of another earthquake, act
of terrorism, flood or other natural disaster
we have an EMERGENCY OPERATIONS
CENTER (EOC) and 911 system. Our public’s
safety must not be compromised.”

ENS IEE SEE EET ES TNE RE AS

It’s time to build the secure new public
safety facility Santa Monica needs. That’s why
so many Santa Monicans have joined together
to pass Proposition EE on the November 5
ballot.

It’s time. It’s necessary.

We were lucky after the Northridge quake.
But Santa Monica's luck can’t last forever.
