JUST A COUPLE OF FACTS ABOUT LION MANAGEMENT PLANS
AND TOOLS AUTHORIZED BY PROPOSED BY 197

Nothing in the Proposition states a preference for or in any way specifies which management
tools should be considered by the Department. Asa result, what actions the Fish and Game
Commission will take to manage the lion population is as yet unknown, but it must be noted that
the bill gives the commission and the Department some specific guidelines.

First:

The Proposition requires the Department to study the population of the mountain lion for three
years. It further requires the Department to determine priority zones where current law is not
sufficient to deal with the mountain lion population. The Department will then develop a
management plans for those zones based on the best available science.

Second:

The Proposition gives the Department and the Commission two specific goals to follow in
developing the plans for each priority zone. Specifically:

e The plan must be one that «...promotes health and safety protection and protection
for livestock, domestic animals, other property, and other wildlife species.”

e The plan must also implements section 1801 of the Fish and Game Code which states
among other things that the department “...encourage the conservation and
maintenance of wildlife resources...maintain sufficient populations....(and)
perpetuate all species...”

Further, the Proposition specifically states that when management tools are considered for the
different plans, they must be:

e “,...consistent with the plan for that zone and maintains a viable mountain lion
population in that zone.”
