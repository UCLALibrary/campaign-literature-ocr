TORT REFORM NEEDED TO IMPROVE
CALIFORNIA’S ECONOMIC CLIMATE

Reforms Enacted in Other States, But Unmatched in California,
Further Threaten Our State’s Jobs and Competitiveness

WHAT WE SAY...

"The risk-takers who create California’s jobs are fully prepared to face the uncertainties of
the marketplace and even the hazards of fire, flood or earthquake. But they can’t survive
the ruinous cost of lawsuit abuse. "--California Governor Pete Wilson, State of the State
address, January 8, 1996.

WHAT THEY SAY...

[Mllinois’ 1995 tort reform enactments] restore fariness to the system and eliminate the
costly and archaic system of the past."--Illinois Governor Jim Edgar, BusinessWeek,
December 11, 1995.

WHAT THEY DID...

A special insert to the December 11 issue of BusinessWeek about the Illinois economic
climate touts the positive impact of the tort reforms passed in 1995 by its Legislature.
Describing the reforms as "a model for national efforts," the article observes that "product
liability and tort reform is already curtailing frivolous lawsuits which can cripple business."

Significantly, since passage of the omnibus tort reform bill, "the number of liability cases
being brought in Illinois has dropped from 25 a week to four."

Punitive damage reforms topped the list of improvements to Illinois’ civil justice system.
Among its provisions, the legislation limited punitive damages to three times economic
damages.

Opponents of common sense legal reforms often attempt to attack the mounting body of
evidence which demonstrates that the tort system harms job creation and the business
climate. The attached full-page advertisement, running nationally, reiterates that our
competitor states recognize the negative impact of lawsuit abuse, and that tort reforms are
essential to attract and maintain a healthy economic base.
