SMRR

Building a safer Santa Monica.

Today, Santa Monica has the lowest crime rate in 20 years.
It’s no accident. The Santa Monica police department has
added 53 officers since 1980. Every significant increase has
been a direct result of the leadership of SMRR-supported
City Council members.

SMRR has also worked for the adoption of community-based

policing, through police substations, bike and foot patrols,

and by nurturing the growth of

community groups that bring
neighbors together to fight
crime. SMRR has supported
upgrading antiquated police
communications systems to
reduce emergency response
time in the city.

SMRR is committed to fully
implementing community-

based policing and creating durable partnerships between
residents and the Santa Monica Police Department.

A sensible homeless policy.

SMRR’s policy on homelessness policy is based upon two
principles: that we have a right to enjoy the full use of our
parks and streets without constantly being panhandled and
harassed; and that we have a responsibility to assist the
homeless in getting back into the mainstream for good.

SMRR Councilmembers have supported laws to prohibit
aggressive panhandling and camping in our parks. They have
also supported shelters, affordable housing, feeding, and
anti-drug and alcohol programs to help the
homeless rejoin society. Homelessness is a
national problem and a national disgrace. The
temptation to simply sweep the problem out
of view is great. SMRR did not take the easy
way — we took the right way.
