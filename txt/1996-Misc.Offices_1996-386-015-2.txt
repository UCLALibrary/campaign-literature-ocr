“Don’t vote.”

Maions of Democrats didn’t vote in 1994.
The result — Newt Gingrich overpowered
Congress and pursued his right-wing agenda:
¢ Health cuts for the elderly

* Cuts in school funding and student loans

¢ Attacks on clean water and clean air laws

¢ Assaults on a woman’s right to choose

¢ Efforts to overturn the assault weapon ban
° Opposition to the liveable wage

There’s one way to stop Gingrich and the
extremists.

We just have to avoid the mistake of 1994.

We just have to vote.
