Proposition 214 is a simple, effective way to ensure that
medical decisions are made by patients and their
doctors—not by HMO bureaucrats.

HMOs should not be allowed to force “gag rules” on doctors, nurses,
and other health care workers, or to enforce unwritten “gag policies”
by firing them without cause. HMOs should not be allowed to deny
doctor-recommended treatments without a second opinion, or to offer financial
bonuses to doctors and nurses to deny or delay needed care. HMOs should be required to publicly
disclose profits and administrative expenses and salaries.
