53rd Assembly District Volunteers for
YES on 187

Dear Friend:

We are local volunteers who worked hard two years ago for passage of Proposition 187,
the 1994 ballot measure to restrict welfare and other public benefits to illegal immigrants.

The voters of the 53rd Assembly District overwhelmingly supported Proposition 187...
60% voting YES.

Debra Bowen, our representative in the State Assembly, opposed Proposition 187.

Dan Walker, her opponent in the November election, supported Proposition 187, and
actively campaigned for its passage-

During the past ten years, over 2 million immigrants have illegally crossed the California
border, costing California taxpayers $3 billion a year...money that should be spent on
education, health care, or other vital services for legal residents..

On the issue of illegal immigration...

THE BOWEN RECORD:

Bowen opposed Proposition 187

¢ Bowen opposed a bill authorizing the National Guard to patrol the border and make arrests
for immigration law violation

e Bowen voted to pay Workers’ Compensation benefits to illegal immigrants who use
fraudulent documents to gain employment

¢ Bowen voted against a bill requiring proof of USS. Citizenship to register to vore and
requiring a photo ID at the polls on election day

¢ Bowen opposed a bill requiring voting materials to be printed only in English

COUNCILMAN DAN WALKER supported Proposition 187 and will support the strong laws
needed to protect the integrity of our border and election process.

The choice is clear...on election day, November 5th, please join with us in voting for
Dan Walker for Assembly.

Sincerely,

ONG. Cora 6 Bon —fCaceetan. &. Ober Catherine. Brotridye
