Campaign

Reform

Candidates for state
office received a
whopping $196 million in
campaign contributions
during the last election
season. One candidate
for the Legislature
received $125,000 from a
tobacco company one

week before the election.

He won by a mere 597
votes, proving that big
money makes a
difference.

Eight out of 10
campaign dollars to
California legislators
come from outside the
district the candidate is
supposed to represent.

Ninety-seven percent
of the money donated to
California politicians
comes from the
wealthiest 1% of
individuals, corporations,
and PACs.

| Bachan ARE SUPPOSED TO
represent the people who
elect them to office. But the
reality is, they often use their
political power to serve those
who give them big campaign
contributions and expect favors
in return. Corporations are
using their heavy financial
influence to buy lobbyists and
politicians at workers’ expense.

Case in point: One provision

of the Gingrich tax plan would
allow people who buy
insurance policies for
catastrophic coverage to set up
new tax-deductible accounts to
offset medical expenses. The
prime mover for these so-called
medical savings accounts:
Golden Rule Insurance Co. One
of the G.O.P.'s biggest donors,
Golden Rule and its chairman,
Patrick Rooney, contributed
$723,505 to the party during the
1994 elections.

Since corporations get a tax
break for their lobbying
expenses, every dime they
spend lobbying is subsidized
by ordinary taxpayers.

Prop. 209 ‘goes too far"

Tt LONG-STANDING
controversy over
affirmative action programs is
now being confronted by a
ballot measure that uses an ax
where a scalpel would do.
Proposition 209, the “California
Civil Rights Initiative” “puts at
risk every outreach program,
sets back the gains made by
women and puts the brakes on
equal opportunity for people in
need...”said retired General
Colin Powell.

In its overzealous approach,
Proposition 209 actually

increases discrimination against
women and minorities in some
cases. The bitterly disputed
“Clause C” creates a loophole
in the Constitution which
allows discrimination against
women if it is “reasonably
necessary.”

Passage of Proposition 209
will undoubtedly open a
Pandora’s Box of new lawsuits
aimed at universities and public
agencies who will have to
spend our tax dollars to prove
that they are not guilty of
“reverse discrimination.”

Proposition 209:

What your vote will do

Proposition 209 eliminates all programs
intended to ensure equal opportunity
‘ for women and minorities. It

prohibits outreach and
recruitment programs to
encourage qualified women
and minorities to apply for
government jobs and
F contracts, or enroll in tutoring
’ and mentoring programs that
would help give them the
opportunity to compete for
college admission. It allows
state and local governments
to discriminate against
women based solely on their
® gender. The California Labor
Federation opposes
Proposition 209.

Between 1979 and
1994, worker productivity
increased 20%, but
workers’ wages went
down 9% after adjusting
for inflation.

For every dollar
earned by the average
American worker,
African-American
workers earn 79 cents,
Latino workers earn 76
cents and women
workers earn 72 cents.

Programs designed to
encourage girls to study
and pursue careers in
math and science would
be eliminated under
Proposition 209.

Proposition 209 would
eliminate outreach
programs that make sure
women and minorities
have an equal
opportunity to compete
for jobs, college
admission and
government contracts.
