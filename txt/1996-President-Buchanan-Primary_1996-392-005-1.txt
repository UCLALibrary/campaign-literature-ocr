Congress of the Anited States
House of Representatives

Congressman Anthony C. Beilenson

pear a.

I write to ask for your vote in next Tuesday's election.

For the past 10 years I have had the privilege of
representing our community in the U.S. Congress and I have
worked hard to serve you well and to legislate in the best
interests of all Americans.

My chief priorities have been stopping illegal immigra-
tion, strengthening law enforcement, reducing wasteful govern-
ment spending and supporting President Reagan's position on
free trade.

Throughout all my years in Congress, I have worked hard to
Maintain my integrity and my independence -- I am one of only 9
members of the House of Representatives who accept no campaign
contributions whatsoever from lobbyists or special interest
groups.

I am seeking your support on the basis of my record of
service to you. I do not believe in the kind of negative and
misleading campaign that my opponent has been waging in this
election and I have, therefore, enclosed a brochure, which I
hope you will read, highlighting my record and my positions on
some of the major issues facing our country today.

I am proud of the many things I have been able to
accomplish with the support and encouragement of so many of
you, and I am extremely grateful for the opportunity you have
given me to represent you these past years.

Sincerely,
wr

Loe BEILENSON
Member of -Congress
