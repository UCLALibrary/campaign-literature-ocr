Adam Schiff

A plan to reform the failed juvenile justice system.

Adam Schiff knows that an effective anti-crime
program must begin with finding ways to keep kids
from choosing a life of crime. Adam Schiff will
make reforming our failed juvenile justice system a
top legislative priority.

The present revolving door juvenile justice system
simply arrests and releases young offenders
without any real punishment — until they do
something truly horrendous.

To prevent crime, we must intervene early and
teach our youth that crime is wrong — and will not
be tolerated. Juvenile court judges must be given
the tools to impose swift and certain penalties for
non-violent criminals, including military-style boot
camps, drug treatment and testing, community
service and restitution to victims. And juvenile
criminals who commit violent crimes must be
prepared to be tried and sentenced as adults.

Our schools are a big part
of the solution as well.
They must do a better
job of instilling the values
that our nation is
founded on: hard work,
respect, and
responsibility.

Brother Program for 40 years.
