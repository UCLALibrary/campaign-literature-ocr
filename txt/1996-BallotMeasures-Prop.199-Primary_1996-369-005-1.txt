VOTE NO PROP. 199

THE PHONY
"RENTAL ASSISTANCE"
INITIATIVE

PROP. 199 DEVASTATES SENIOR CITIZEN MOBILEHOME
OWNERS. THOUSANDS OF WIDOWS, WIDOWERS AND
OTHER SENIORS WILL FACE LOSS OF THEIR
MOBILEHOMES IFIT PASSES. HELP SAVE OUR SENIOR
CITIZENS FROM EVICTION FROM THEIR HOMES.

v 400,000 Californians (mostly senior citizens) own
mobilehomes, but not the land they sit on. They rent a small slice of
bare land from a park owner. Some monthly space rents are higher than Social
Security and retirement incomewill allow. Senior mobilehome owners are trapped
when rents increase. It can cost $10,000 to move the mobilehome, and available
spaces are scarce. Homeowners must either pay the rent or lose their homes, and
the equity they have in them.

v___ Prop. 199 takes away rental assistance from seniors. Prop.
499 removes mobilehome rent protections. Prop. 199's sponsors are mobilehome
park landlords who want to raise mobilehome rents without limit, whenever they
choose.

v._Don'tbe misled. Prop. 199's so-called "rental assistance"
is a FRAUD. It gives a 10% discount on rents park owners alone determine.
What good is a 10% discount after rents have risen 50%? Few, if any, seniors will
get the "subsidy".
