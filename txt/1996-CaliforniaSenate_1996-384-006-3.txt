to Phil Hawkins
and His Deadly Little Secrets

Phil Hawkins’ bill for mass legalization of
concealed weapons was deadly disregard
for public safety and law enforcement.

This year, he helped the Assembly approve
it. Now he wants to go to the Senate and
finish the job.

m% If Phil Hawkins wins, thousands of people
could soon be carrying loaded, hidden
handguns. In stores. At theaters and

; concerts. In the car next to you. In police
stations. At schools.

The closer you look, the worse he gets.
