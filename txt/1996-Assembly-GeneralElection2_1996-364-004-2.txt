Debra Bowen — well rewarded by
the personal injury trial lawyers

Bowen took $45,429

Frivolous lawsuits ... they cost all of us
in the form of higher taxes, higher prices
and increased court costs.

Last year alone, California’s 118,000
lawyers filed over one million new civil
lawsuits. It just keeps getting worse ...
and the only ones benefiting are the per-
sonal injury trial lawyers.

Why do the ambulance chasing personal
injury trial lawyers contribute so much
money to lawyer Assemblywoman Debra

Bowen? Because they can count on her
to vote against lawsuit reform legislation
that could save all of us — taxpayers,
consumers and business owners — millions
of dollars.

Personal injury trial lawyers don’t
want lawsuit reform. It would hit them
where it hurts — in the pocketbook.
So they keep opening wallets to Bowen
— and we all end up paying for it.
