Barry grew up in a typical middle class home. His father was a postal worker and his mother was a

salesclerk at May Co. But they were always able to get by and save for the future.

By the late ‘80s, Barry became deeply concerned with the erosion of living standards for working
men and women. In 1987, Barry decided to run for Vice President of his own union — the Screen
