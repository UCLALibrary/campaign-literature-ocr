Thank you all very much.

It’s wonderful to be here at CPAC, the home of the
conservative movement.

One can’t come to CPAC without thinking of Ronald
Reagan, the two are so closely associated. First as
Governor, then as President, he was the featured speaker
in every conference from the first in 1974 to his last term
in office -- except for two years, '76 and '80, when in his
words, he was unavoidably detained “by some business in
New Hampshire that wouldn’t wait.”

And I was thinking of Ronald Reagan’s famous
“Time for Choosing” speech in 1964 that was instrumental
in launching today’s modem conservative movement. In
that address, Ronald Reagan said, America is at a
crossroads, but the decision is not whether to turn right or
left. The great decision before America is “up:or down” --
whether to turn up to freedom, to embrace the hope and
possibilities of the future. Or to turn down, to the swamp
of statism and government control.

Ronald Reagan gave that address more than 30 years
ago, but the words speak to us just as urgently today.
