Vote NO on Prop 209

Save Affirmative Action
for Women and People of Color

Save Women’s Rights

DON’T BUY THE LIE!

Prop 209 says one thing,
but means another.

Prop 209 eliminates affirmative action programs
for women and people of color in public jobs,
education and contracting

Prop 209 weakens laws protecting women and
girls from discrimination and sexual harassment
in public jobs, education, and contracting

Turn Card Over for Women’s and Civil Rights groups
OPPOSED to Prop 209
