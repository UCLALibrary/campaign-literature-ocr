teve For A age 11.

America. Not about green eyeshades and charts & graphs,
but about heart and soul. Giving individuals and families
more control over their lives.

I believe that this country is on the verge of a spiritual
renewal the likes of which we have never seen before, a
New American Awakening that retums our nation to the
wellsprings of family and faith, that re-invigorates the
strong moral values on which our nation was founded.

But we need to get Government out of the way. We
need to do a major housecleaning, because everywhere we
look in our community and civic life, and increasingly in
our personal lives, government is there. And it isn't
helping.

Americans suffocated by in-your-face government
deserve some breathing room at long last.

Government tells our children that they may not pray
to their Maker, the Lord and giver of life, in school.

Government perpetuates a welfare system that breaks
families, rather than building them up, and exposes our
Cities and countryside to pathologies of violence and crime
that we have never seen before.

Government imposes a tax system that punishes
marriage. Why do you think the tax code is 29,000 pages
long? To hide from the people the truth -- that the
government punishes people when they work hard and are
productive. Punishes them when they save for their future
and their children's education.
