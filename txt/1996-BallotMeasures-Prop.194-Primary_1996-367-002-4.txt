Sucn conclusions depend, of course, on the credibility of the Regression-
Discontinuity design. A number of tests are undertaken to determine if the
design "took," and all of the diagnostics lead to favorable conclusions. We
are indeed able to closely approximate the ability of randomized experiments
to produce unbiased estimates of any treatment effects; influences that might
normally ‘be confounded with the effects of the benefits are effectively con-
trolled.

The smaller ‘study reported in Part I also yields important results.

By and large, the underlying mechanisms unearthed mirror the findings from

be expected to produce beneficial effects dueralt. ‘if they do not encourage
large numbers of ex-offenders to postpone finding work. In the present

case, it appears that the modest payments (about $45 a week) and considerable
delays (about five to seven weeks) between applying for the payments and
arrival of the first check may minimize work disincentives. Forty-five dollars
a week is not especially competitive with legitimate earnings, and the present
discounted value of such payments in the face of a long waiting period makes
legitimate wages still more attractive. In other words, ex-offenders with
any, reasonable job prospects have good reason to start work immediately. At

tipped in the direction of law abiding behavior.

Conclusions

There is certainly no simple or single remedy for serious crime. Many

approaches are required and, even then, there will always be some residual
