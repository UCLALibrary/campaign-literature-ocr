Bond Measure BB is a ballot initiative that will provide funds
to repair aging school buildings in Los Angeles. Many of
our schools are badly in need of health and safety related
maintenance, as well as educational facility upgrades.

Money allocated to Westwood by Bond Measure BB will be used for:
+ Playground Repaving
+ Kir Conditioning
+ Wiring for Computer Education

Cost to taxpayers of Bond Measure BB
+ $15 per $100,000 of assessed property value in the first
year
+ $40 per assessed $100,000 in property value in the
following years

Westwood Charter School will receive $1,040,000 for repairs
and upgrades if Bond Measure BB is approved!

- Vote November 5th!
