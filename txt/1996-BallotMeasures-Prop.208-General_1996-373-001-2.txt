California voters have reached the boiling
point about big money in politics.

Too many politicians say one thing, then do
something else. Why? Because they serve the
special interests who give them big campaign
contributions, not the voters back home in their
districts.

On November 5th, we can crack down on big
money in politics by passing Proposition 212. It is
the toughest campaign reform in the country.

But there’s a problem. Another nice-sounding
measure is on the ballot -- Prop 208. If it also passes,
it will negate 212’s tough reforms. 208 is a poison
pill which could kill real reform.

208 replicates weak federal campaign finance
laws which have left Congress awash in special
interest money. Do we really want to reform
California politics only to have it look like national
politics?

Vote No on 208 (For details on Prop 208, please
read the reverse side of this card.)

Vote Yes on 212. It forces political candidates
to raise at least 75% of their money within their
own districts. It sets tough, low contribution limits.
It bans corporate contributions and eliminates the
corporate tax deduction for lobbying. 208 does
none of these things.

Vote no on 208.

COSTS 100 MUCH!
DOES TOO LITTLE!
