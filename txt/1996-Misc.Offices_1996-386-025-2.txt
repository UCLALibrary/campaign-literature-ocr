PAUL KORETZ

MAYOR
CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD

Dear Friend:

I am writing because I am deeply concerned about several
propositions on the November ballot. We will be voting on
measures that could have an enormous impact on the quality of life
in our community, as well as the quality of local government and
its ability to deliver the services you depend upon.

During the recent economic recession, the state balanced its
budget by diverting property tax revenues from local government,
creating severe shortfalls in budgets for schools, police, libraries and
parks. Proposition 217 would retain existing top tax brackets for the
wealthiest 1% of Californians, and dedicate these funds to schools
and local government. Prop. 217 deserves your support.

On the other hand, Proposition 218 is a dangerous proposal
which would give large landowners, including non-citizens, far more
voting power than average homeowners, and deny voting rights to
renters entirely. It would cut current funding for police, fire and
library services by more than $100 million yearly. Please vote NO
on Prop. 218.

The other side of this card presents additional critical issues,
including continuing affirmative action, increasing the minimum
wage, and reforming campaign finance laws. I hope you will give
these measures careful consideration before casting your vote.

Sincerely,

Paul Koretz "63
