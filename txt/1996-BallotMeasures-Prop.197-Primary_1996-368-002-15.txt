Dear Senator Hayden:

As you requested in your March 30, 1995 letter regarding mountain lions, the
Department of Fish and Game's staff has developed responses to the questions you posed.
These responses were developed with input from Mr. Terry M. Mansfield, Chief of the
Department's Wildlife Management Division, and other staff knowledgeable of the status of
mountain lions in California. Answers are provided in the order in which the questions
appeared in your letter. :

1. Question: Is it your testimony that the current number of mountain lions in
California is between 4,000 and 6,000? What is your response to the claim that
the numbers are undercounted because juvenile mountain lions are not included
in the count?

Response: The Department's 1989 estimate of the statewide mountain lion
population was approximately 5,100 adults. However, a more reasonable estimate
was a range which was likely between “4,000 and 6,000 adult lions. These
estimates did not include kittens and subadults younger than two years of age.
These estimates were biologically conservative in that they did not include young
animals. The Department's experience in a number of long-term field studies
during the 1980s documented high mortality, rates among kittens and young lions.

The most common number of kittens in a litter at birth was three. In general,
only two survived one year, and only one was recruited into the adult breeding
population at two years of age. This information was the basis for not including
kittens and subadults in the best estimate of the statewide population. The
method used produced a recognized conservative estimate of the statewide
population.

It is important to recognize that the 1989 estimates were developed from extensive
field studies through the 1980s in a number of areas extending from Siskiyou
