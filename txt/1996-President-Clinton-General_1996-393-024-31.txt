Who does he
think he’s
kidding?

America tried this in the 1980s, remember? The tax cut benefited
mostly the wealthy, and it sent the federal budget deficit soaring to record
levels. Interest rates climbed, and soon our country was thrown into
along recession.

Bob Dole’s tax-cut plan would have the same result. Either the deficit
skyrockets — saddling future generations with enormous debt, or Dole
“pays”’ for his tax cuts by cutting college loans, safety and health
standards, education funding, Medicare, Medicaid and other programs.
Either way, you and your family lose.

Under President Clinton, the deficit is less than half as large as it
was four years ago. And the President has done it while keeping his
commitment to education, the environment and quality health care.

The American Federation of Teachers
endorses Bill Clinton for re-election.
