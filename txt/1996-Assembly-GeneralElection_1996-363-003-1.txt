Democrat DEBRA BOWEN under attack by Orange County
Right-Wingers!

The Radical Orange County Republican machine has targeted our
Democratic Assemblywoman DEBRA BOWEN for defeat. They will
print and say anything just to beat her.

According to the Daily Breeze newspaper, Debra's opponent Dan Walker
has been mailing misleading and untruthful information to voters about
Debra. Don't believe Dan Walker's dirty smear campaign.

DEBRA BOWEN is supported for re-election by local teachers,
firefighters, police officers and the Sierra Club. She has led the fight for
better schools, a cleaner environment, and safer neighborhoods.

You can send a message to the Radical Right Republicans that they are out
of touch with our community — Vote to re-elect DEBRA BOWEN to the
State Assembly!

On Tuesday, please join Democratic leaders in supporting Democrat
DEBRA BOWEN for Assembly.

Senator Dianne Feinstein
Lt. Governor Gray Davis
State Controller Kathleen Connell
