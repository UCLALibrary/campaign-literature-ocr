Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 207

The corporate lobbyists and special interests
who oppose Proposition 207 are being unfair to
California Attommey General Dan Lungren when they
selectively quote his OFFICIAL TITLE AND
SUMMARY.

They are trying to make it look like he used
his official position to say Proposition 207 does
nothing about frivolous lawsuits.

That's wrong.

They left out the part of the Attorney General's
OFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY that talks about
punishing lawyers who file Frivolous Lawsuits:

Proposition 207:

“Authorizes court to impose sanctions upon
attorney who files a lawsuit or pleading which is
completely without merit or filed solely to harass the
opposing party.”

Attorney General Lungren's OFFICIAL TITLE
AND SUMMARY goes on to say:

09/09/96 11:25 TX/RX NO.0521
