YE$ ON PROPOSITION 217-

ition of taxpayers, teachers, firefighters, seniors, law enforcement, tax reform organizations and labor.

ALIFORNIA, whose 5.8
million student population
pia is the nation’s largest,
<.3 will add a million more
students over the next 10 years—an
18% increase. Currently, California
jams more kids into every classroom
than any other state in the nation.

The state’s new $971 million
program to reduce early elementary
school class sizes to 20 has set off
a scramble among the state’s 1,000
school districts to come up with the
additional money they'll need to take
advantage of the incentive program.
Statewide, it's estimated that the
effort will require 26,000 new
teachers and other resources for the
increased number of classrooms.

For example, even if Los Angeles
Unified School District, the state's
largest with 650,000 students, is
able to reduce first and second grade

class sizes with the help of state
money, it must find an additional
$47 million to pay teacher salaries
and purchase supplies to meet its
goals. Sacramento City’s 49,000-
student school district needs $1
million more to cut first grade
class sizes.

Prop. 217 will
provide school
districts with some
of the additional
funding they need to
help California's
students rise to
excellence. Prop. 217
provides funding for
California schools and
communities without
cutting or affecting any
other state or local programs. It
accomplishes this by keeping the
top income tax brackets—which
expire this year—in place for the
wealthiest 1% of Californians.
