“It just goes too far and it
has national implications.
(211 would) invite the
filing of frivolous lawsuits”

President

Bill Clinton
August 7,1996

“This proposition could have a
very adverse effect on California
driving both businesses and jobs
out of the state...(211) would
create a ‘lawsuit environment’ in
California that could send many
high-tech companies to other
states, costing California jobs.”

Dianne Feinstein
U.S. Senator

“I am convinced the
passage of Proposition 211
will cast a shadow over

your economic recovery.
Prop 211 must be defeated”

Presidential Candidate

Bob Dole
August 6, 1996

“This initiative would curtail
California’s economic recovery.

It’s a job killer that would send
California’s best high-tech and
bio-tech companies to other states.”

ON PROPOSITION 211

“211 doesn’t protect seniors
or our retirement savings.
In fact, it jeopardizes our
pensions and savings by
allowing unscrupulous
lawyers to ‘legally extort’
billions from companies in
which our pensions invest.”
Bill Miller

Former AARP / VOTE
Deputy State Coordinator

“211 jeopardizes critical
research into new treatments
and cures for many life-
threatening diseases. It
takes millions of dollars from
research and sends it to the
pocket books of a few
wealthy securities lawyers.”
John Gorman

Alzheimer Aid Society
of Northern California

“This measure is not about
protecting seniors, it’s about
protecting the ability of
opportunistic lawyers to
continue to make millions by
filing frivolous lawsuits.”

Oran McNeil
Member, The 60 Plus
Association

“Every California taxpayer
should oppose Proposition
211. It could mean billions
in lost state revenue which
could only be replaced
through massive tax hikes
or reductions in services.”

Larry McCarthy
President, California
Taxpayers Association

“Unless Proposition 211 is
defeated, California would
become a haven for frivolous
lawsuits which would clog
California’s already over-
burdened courts.” 3
George W. Kennedy

District Attorney,
Santa Clara County

“Prop. 211 invites lawyers
from across America to race
to California and make easy
money by filing frivolous
lawsuits. It means a weaker
economy, fewer jobs and less
total income for the people of
California.”

Kirk West

President, California
Chamber of Commerce

“We can’t do anything that
would reduce (high-tech
companies’) willingness and
commitment to retain
business in California...
Proposition 211 would put
California at a tremendous
disadvantage.”

Kathleen Connell
State Controller

“...211 is a disaster for small
business in California. As
companies relocate and jobs
are lost, every community in
California will be damaged.
Proposition 211 is nothing
more than a guarantee of
another recession.”
Martyn Hopper
State Director, National

Federation of Independent
Businesses

“Proposition 211 isn’t about
protecting us from fraud.
It isn’t about being able to
recover legitimate losses.
We’re already protected.
Seniors, families, taxpayers,
small businesses and
employees say “NO on 211.”

Vice President,
Hispanic Women’s Council
