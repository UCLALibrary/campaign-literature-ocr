Dear Neighbor:

Because your organization is one of many which uses Los Angeles school facilities, I want
to be sure you are aware of a local school repair and construction bond measure that will
appear on your November ballot.

Iam sure that you are well aware of the physical condition of most of our schools. For
example, heating and ventilation systems do not always work, electrical systems are
inadequate, roofs leak and fire alarm systems are in need of repair. Many schools need
earthquake retrofitting. Plumbing, heating and sewer systems have deteriorated and are in
need of replacement. Students and staff are in hot, stuffy classrooms. Thousands of
students continue to be transported out of their neighborhood because of overcrowding.

Proposition BB, our local School Repair and Construction measure, is on the November 5
ballot. If the bond is passed by a two-thirds majority, property owners will pay $14.71 for
each $100,000 of assessed valuation (not market value) in the first year. Over the life of the
bond, the cost will average $38.56 per year for each $100,000 of assessed valuation to
address the repair and construction needs of all of the schools in the District.

I have enclosed an informational brochure regarding Proposition BB and ask that you share
the information with your friends and neighbors. If you need further information about the
bond measure, please call the Bond Information Office at (213) 633-3740.

Together we can continue to make a difference in the lives of young children and the future
of our community.

Sincerely,

Eat Ghote are

Sidney A. Thompson
