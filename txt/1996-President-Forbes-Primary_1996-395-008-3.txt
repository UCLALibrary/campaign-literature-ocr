Build real
Social Security.

No more Washington-style “reform” of Social Security, which means raising
taxes and lowering benefits. We must strengthen security for our elderly —
and make the system sound for the future — with guaranteed savings in a
growing private sector.

Create medical
savings accounts.

Put the consumer in charge, with private medical savings accounts coupled
with insurance policies that provide seamless and complete coverage (no
more Medigaps!). We did a variation of medical savings accounts at Forbes
magazine, and it is very effective and popular.

AUS., nota U.N.,
foreign policy.

Freedom at “ue depends on strength abroad. As Chairman of Radio Free
Europe and publisher of Forbes magazine, my work with business leaders and
heads of state has brought me to more than 60 countries. I know from per-
sonal experience that America is still the “last, best hope for mankind.” We
need a Commander in Chief who recognizes our unique role in the world. One
who conducts a U.S., not a U.N., foreign policy.

Married for 24 years, Steve Forbes and his wife, Sabina, are raising five daughters ages 8 through 22.
