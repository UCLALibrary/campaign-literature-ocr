FROM THE DESK OF ANNA Sid BOYCE, R.N.

OFFICIAL PROPOSITION 215 PROPONENT

“WE CAN REDUCE SUFFERING AND PROLONG LIVES.”

Dear Fellow Californian:

I’ve been a Registered Nurse for 27 years. I’ve seen people courageously battle grave
illnesses. I know that marijuana, under a doctor’s supervision, can sometimes ease
human suffering.

Two years ago my husband J.J. was
diagnosed with lung cancer. He
went through hell — chemotherapy
was agony. Luckily, I knew about
the medical use of marijuana. A few
puffs after chemotherapy blocked
his nausea, and made his last
months bearable.

In 1995, the California Legislature

-passed a bill permitting the
regulated, medical use of marijuana
under the strict care of a physician.
But Governor Pete Wilson, who
was running for President, vetoed
the bill — as he had a similar bill in
1994.

Those of us who had worked so hard to pass those two bills decided to go straight to
the voters. We collected over 775,000 signatures to put Proposition 215 on the ballot.

Patients in other states, like Ohio and Florida, are permitted to use medical marijuana
without fearing arrest, public exposure and jail time. With your help, we can give the
same protection to seriously and terminally ill people here in California. Please vote

yes on Proposition 215!
