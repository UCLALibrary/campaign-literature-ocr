Medical Marijuana vs. Marinol
Opponents of Proposition 215 claim that medical marijuana is not
needed because synthetic THC (trade name Marinol) is already available. But

Marinol is not always the right choice for cancer or AIDS patients se
nausea, vomiting or “wasting syndrome,” because:

¢ Marinol costs as much as $30,000 per year for a single patient’s
prescription of two capsules, four times a day.

¢ Asahighly concentrated form of the most psychoactive substance
in marijuana, Marinol often “knocks out” patients who use it.

Others experience dizziness, extreme anxiety, disorientation and
headaches.

¢ Patients suffering nausea and vomiting find that pills can be
difficult to swallow, digest and keep down. Marinol is thus much
less useful after the onset of nausea.

¢ Patients suffering the “wasting syndrome” in cancer or AIDS
treatment do not typically experience heightened appetite from
Marinol; with marijuana, appetite improves and food intake
increases, improving overall health.

Marinol is not truly a “pill form” of marijuana. THC is only one of
more than 400 chemicals in the pure plant — 60 or more of them, known
collectively as cannabinoids, are unique to the marijuana plant. Some of the
other components in marijuana, such as cannabidiol, have shown promise
in preliminary medical studies, but there is currently no way to legally obtain
them for medical treatment.

Many patients simply find benefits from whole marijuana — whether
inhaled, baked into foods or prepared in fluids — that they do not find in
Marinol alone. Rapid absorbtion of inhaled marijuana into the bloodstream
means more immediate relief than Marinol brings, and inhalation permits
dosage control by the patient. Increased appetite from marijuana use can be
life-saving for patients whose treatments induce “wasting syndrome.”

Until marijuana’s medical potential is fully understood, Prop. 215 will
permit its use as an alternative medication, under a doctor’s order.
