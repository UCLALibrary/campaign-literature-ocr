Seniors for

Last May, with the support of the California Commission on Aging, the California Senior
Legislature, AARP and most every other senior citizen organization in California, the
Older California Act came up for a final vote in the State Assembly.

This landmark bill provided the funding for vital services for seniors, including:

¢ home-delivered meals for seniors unable to cook for themselves, such as those with
Alzheimer’s Disease.

¢ in-home services for seniors who need assistance with the basic tasks of daily living.

¢ transportation to the doctor for vital medical services or the pharmacists for drugs
which are necessary in order to survive.

¢ the Office of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman which prevents physical abuse of

seniors in nursing homes.
It passed 70-1.

DEBRA BOWEN, your representative in the State Assembly, voted NO...
the ONLY member of the entire California Legislature to do so
(it passed the State Senate unanimously).

Debra Bowen has a long record of opposing or refusing to vote for bills
important to seniors.

Bowen voted NO on requiring a back-ground check for in-home providers, refused to vote
on a bill to provide increased penalties for a person who knowingly defrauds senior

citizens, and voted NO to extend current property tax exemptions for veterans.

She even voted NO on increasing the penalties for a person convicted of burning a church,
synagogue, temple or other place of worship... AND AGAIN was the ONLY member of the
Assembly to do so... it passed 71-1. ;

If Debra Bowen won't support us, it’s time we elect a representative who will.

Elected five times to the Torrance City Council, DAN WALKER has a proven history of

supporting programs and services for seniors.

When elected to the State Assembly, DAN WALKER will vote FOR the rights of seniors and
FOR the vital services that are needed to improve the quality of life.
