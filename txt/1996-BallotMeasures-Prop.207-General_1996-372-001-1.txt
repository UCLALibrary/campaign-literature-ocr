WHY CALIFORNIA IS CRITICAL TO
CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM
1s Punitive damages are a multi-million dollar problem, growing more rapidly than any
economic indicator.
D California employment law is the worst of any other major state.

Sh, The California Supreme Court and seven Courts of Appeal produce a large volume of
published appellate decisions, often setting precedent for the rest of the nation.

4. California trial lawyers contribute a large percentage of the trial lawyer campaign
funding going to state and federal candidates nationally.

ah California's product liability law, though becoming more mainstream, is still tipped
markedly toward plaintiffs.

6. California is home of some of the most aggressive class action plaintiffs' attorneys in
the nation.

Th, California trial lawyers are on the leading edge of a national image-changing effort.

8. Elections and internal disputes have California trial lawyers off balance at the
moment.

9. California law schools produce a huge number of lawyers -- over the past 10 years the
number of attorneys here grew by 44% while population grew by 10%.

10. â€˜The auto liability system, singled out by Rand for encouraging excessive claiming,
conditions people to sue and is a training ground for personal injury lawyers.
