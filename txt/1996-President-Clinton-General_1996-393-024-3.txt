FIRST TELEPHONE CALL
Teachers

and I’m calling from the (name of your union). I’d
like very much to know your feelings about the November 5th Presidential election.

#1.Would you say that you are: (Read and record response)

a. Strongly supporting Bill Clinton---(Go to Question #2)

b. Leaning to Bill Clinton -(Go to Question #3)

c. Undecided-------------- (Go to Question #3)

d. Leaning to Bob Dole----(Go to Question #4 -- if Senate race, go to #5)

e. Strongly supporting Bob Dole------(Go to Question #4 -- if Senate race, go to #5)

#2. Please talk to your family and friends about President Clinton. Your help is important to
winning on November 5th. (Continue with #5 if Senate race)

#3. As you know, our union has looked at the issues that effect our jobs and our families.
Based on these issues, we have endorsed the re-election of President Clinton and Vice-
President Gore.

For example, President Clinton stood firm against Newt Gingrich and the Congress
when they tried to cut the Department of Education and funding for programs to help
at-risk students.

Giving public funds to private schools, Bob Dole wants to use $2.5 billion dollars in
public schools funding for private or religious schools. President Clinton is against
vouchers.

Also, President Clinton vetoed the budget bill in order to save Medicare and Medicaid
from drastic cuts. He signed the Child Immunization Act to increase the vaccination
rate for children. And he increased funds for breast cancer research.

Please consider these and other issues before voting on November Sth. (Continue
with #5 if Senate race)

#4, Thanks for your time. Goodbye.

#5. As you know, there is also an election for the U.S. Senate this November. If the election
were held today, who would you support? (Record response)

Thank you for taking the time to talk with me. Good night.
