“Only one candidate for

State Senate — Paula Boland —
can be counted on to
support our tough

3-Strikes Law”

Secretary of State
Bill Jones

Author, “3-Strikes-and- You’re-Out”

Dear Concerned Voter,

The campaign for State Senate in your district is full of claims about who supported our tough
3-Strikes-and- You’re-Out law and who did not.

As the Legislative author of 3-Strikes, I want to set the record straight.

Only Assemblywoman Paula Boland supported the tough version of 3-Strikes, and only Paula
Boland can be trusted to uphold 3-Strikes when liberals try to water it down in the Legislature.

Don’t believe what Adam Schiff is telling you. I checked the facts. Adam Schiff did not support the

tough version of 3-Strikes. Instead, Schiff supported a watered down 3-strikes bill promoted by
liberals. It did nothing to punish most repeat, serious offenders. I know, because I was there.

On the other hand, Paula Boland has been there in support of 3-Strikes since day one. And as Chair

of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, Boland took the lead in passing tough-on-crime laws like
3-Strikes that are, this very day, working to make our communities safer.

Paula Boland wrote the “One-Strike-and- You’re-Out” Law against child molesters and the law that
allows school principals to remove troublemakers from campus.

The person paying for Adam Schiff’s campaign, Senator Bill Lockyer, led the fight against our
efforts to save 3-Strikes and against just about every other tough anti-crime measure introduced in

the legislature over the last two years.

So please, don’t be misled by Adam Schiff and his slick campaign for State Senate.

If you care about saving 3-Strikes and making our communities safer, elect Paula Boland to the
State Senate.

Sincerely,
Bill Jones

P.S. There’s a reason why every major crime victim group, and every major police group that really
cares about public safety, are endorsing Paula Boland--she stands up for us.
