Do Gg Kahn:

Do you believe the Republicans in Congress have
gone too far?

Do you believe your interests and priorities are being
trampled by Newt Gingrich and his right wing
agenda?

I do, and I need your help to stop them.

I’m running for Congress because I want to
represent mainstream values and priorities.

Priorities like freedom of choice, education, a ban on
Saturday Night Specials, and economic growth.

In Congress, I’ll fight for your agenda, not | theirs.
