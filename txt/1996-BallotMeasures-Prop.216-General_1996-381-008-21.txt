Proposition 214

Proposition 214, whose backers call it
the Patients Rights Initiative. is solid, but
has serious problems. Its chief strength
is the same as Proposition 216's: It puts
control of your medical care in your doc-
tor’s hands. It also {s very tough on dis-
closure. Under it, an HMO will have to
tell you how it is spending your and your
employer's money, including how much

it puts into such administrative costs as
advertising and marketing, as well as
bonusés. incentives and stock options of
directors and officers. It protects patient
privacy, however.

Proposition 214 has some serious
flaws, however. First, it needs only a
simple majority of the Legislature to
amend. That makes it subject to the
whims of year-to-year politics and, in ef-
fect, extracts its teeth.

Proposition
214 also outlaws
firing employees
except for “just
cause” — de-
priving an em-
bes the right
to make per-
sonnel decisions
that it might need
to make for eco-
nomic reasons.
This last provi-
sion is, oppo-
nents believe, a
sop to the Service
Employees International Union, which is
backing Proposition 214 and which has

100,000 members who would be covered

by It. :

‘Question of cost

EMO executives say both initiatives are
going to send health care costs skyrock-
etng as they are forced to pass along
their new expenditures to consumers.

This {s enother place Proposition 216
parts company. Its wording mandates
that any cost increase not be passed
along to consumers, but instead come
from a tax on mergers and acquisitions
and other HMO financial dealings, Nader
calls them “greed fees.”

Backers of Proposition 214 shied awey
from a watchdog group because they wor-
ried voters would not like it. We fee! the
oppesite: we think health care con-
sumers ere worried about their care and
are ready to take a chance on someone,
like RosenBeld’s group, which micht ac-
tually, do something about it.

Proposition 214's timidity was ill-ad-
vised. Nonetheless, the initiative ts gener-
ally 2 good one. Proposition 216 is better.

HMOs, for thelr part, say they know
the system 1s imperfect, but they have
been tinkering here and there and will -
continue to tinker to make it berter. They
say consumers are satisfied with every-
thing except cost They say to trust them.

If you do trust them, and think they're
doing a swell Job, then vote down both
these inttatives. If you think it is time for
some meaningtul reform tn our health
care system, then vote for Froposition
216. It's a good star.
