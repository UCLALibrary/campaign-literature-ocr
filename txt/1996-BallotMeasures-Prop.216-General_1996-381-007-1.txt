STOP GAG RULES AND HMO ABUSES!
Support County Health Care!

By Bruce Lee Livingston, Executive Director, Health Access

he Health Access California Board endorses and has

joined the campaign for two statewide ballot
initiatives to protect the quality of health care for all
Californians and to expand local health care access.

"It is simply wrong to gag doctors or to pay nurses
incentives to deny care that patients need. In the name of
cost-cutting and profits, HMOs and other health care
businesses are forcing down the quality of health care with
little regard for the consequences for patients," said
Howard Owens, Chair of the Health Access California
Board. Howard Owens is also Legislative Director of the
Congress of California Seniors.

Health Access California Supports:
The Health Care Patient Protection Act of 1996

Health Access California supports a highly winnable
initiative, the "Health Care Patient Protection Act of
1996" which would protect the quality.of care for all
Californians by better regulating managed care. The
introduction of Medi-Cal and Medicare recipients to
managed care make this initiative increasingly relevant to
millions of California seniors, children and poor people.

The Health Care Patient Protection Act of 1996
provides rights and guarantees to health care consumers,
therefore it contains no new fees or taxes and creates no
mew government agencies. Patients need protections in
the age of managed care.

Health Access California promises to work to qualify
and pass this measure which is also supported by
Neighbor to Neighbor, California Physicians Alliance,
Service Employees International Union and Local 250
Health Care Workers Union. We encourage consumer
advocacy organizations to endorse and gather signatures for
this initiative. Single payer advocates can win one for
HMO patients this year! The initiative will:

Les ANGELES CFIA

# Require a second opinion, including a physical
examination, before care can be denied.

# Prohibit gag rules on doctors, nurses and other care
givers. Gag rules are contract provisions which
prevent providers from telling patients what they need
to know about their own health care.

Prohibit Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)
and other insurers from paying bonuses and incentives
to deny or delay needed care.

Force HMOs and other insurers to disclose how
much of the consumer’s dollars goes to waste,
bureaucracy and excessive profits.

In order to defend whistle blowers, prevent HMOs
and other health care businesses from firing doctors,
nurses and other health care workers without cause.
Require safe staffing level standards in hospitals,
nursing homes and other health facilities.

Create written criteria for the denial of care — criteria
developed by practicing health professionals.

Health Access California Supports:
The Local Control and Fiscal Responsibility Act.

Health Access California also endorses the Local
Control and Fiscal Responsibility Act which would help
to fund county hospitals, public health departments and
local health care across California. This measure is not a
new tax — it would continue the top bracket of the income
tax that Governor Wilson allowed to sunset on January 1,
1996 and would devote the proceeds to local government
for schools and health care.

"Repeated cuts in local government funding have
made it difficult for counties to provide health care for the
seven million Californians without health insurance," said
Howard Owens. "The crisis last summer in Los Angeles
will be repeated again and again, in county after county
unless health care receives the funding it needs."
