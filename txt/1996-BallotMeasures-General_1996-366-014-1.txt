Dear Fellow Los Angeles Resident:

Next year, after 40 years working in our public schools both as a teacher and an
administrator, I am retiring. During my years working in this community, I have visited
hundreds of schools and classrooms.

Our teachers and staff continue to work hard to provide the best education possible
for our children. Unfortunately, the physical condition of our schools often negatively
impacts the quality of education. Schools built 40, 50, 60, 70 years ago are worn down,
deteriorating, and in some cases unsafe. Electrical systems, plumbing systems, roofs,
heating and air conditioning systems need replacement at many schools.

The Board of Education has placed Proposition BB on the ballot this November for
your consideration and action. Proposition BB, if passed by Los Angeles voters, will
provide local funds to repair our schools.

I urge you to study your ballot arguments, both pro and con, and make an informed
vote.

Sincerely,

ile ae Or

Sid Thompson
