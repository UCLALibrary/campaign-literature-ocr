Santa Monica Lawyer,
© # Adam Schiff moves to
Hollywood to run for Assembly on a
platform of bigger government and
raising taxes. Although he is badly
defeated, Schiff catches the eye of
Willie Brown who decides to train him
for another campaign.

Willie Brown sends
: Schiff to Burbank to run
ane former Judge James Rogan
where, again, the voters reject him
soundly. Despite a voter registration
scandal and a federal investigation,
he convinces the liberals and
Trial Lawyers in Sacramento to let him
try again.

Willie Brown may have
left, but Schiff returns
with a new patron, San Francisco area

~ Lawyer and Senator Bill Lockyer and

California Trial Lawyers who pour
hundreds of thousands of special
interest contributions into Schiff’s
campaign against local Assemblywoman
Paula Boland.

Schiff thinks he can fool us by working for a new coach,
but he’s still playing on the same old liberal team.
