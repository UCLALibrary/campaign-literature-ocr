TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLEAN
CAMPAIGN PLEDGE.

WHAT COULD FRANCINE POSSIBLY
OBJECT TO?

Francine Oschin refused to sign the California
“Code of Fair Campaign Practices” that’s given
to every candidate. She didn’t sign it when she
filed to be on the ballot. Francine Oschin has
had plenty of other chances to sign the pledge
- and she still refuses.

This is the Official State of California “Code of
Fair Campaign Practices” that every candidate
is asked to sign by the Secretary of State.
