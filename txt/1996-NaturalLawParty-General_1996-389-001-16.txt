CRIME AND REHABILITATION PLATFORM

Drug and alcohol rehabilitation—A high pro-
portion of crimes are committed under the in-
fluence of alcohol and drugs. A recent study of
crime in New York City found that tobacco,
alcohol, and drug abuse cost the city’s taxpay-
ers and corporations $20 billion in 1994—21
cents of every tax dollar [20]. The Natural Law
Party would introduce programs proven to re-
duce drug dependency, eliminate stress, and pro-
mote mental and physical health [21].

Preventing youth crime—School drop-outs are
at highest risk for crime and drug abuse. The
Natural Law Party strongly supports more
effective educational programs to keep children
in school, off the streets, and out of the reach of
crime. Our proven educational programs unfold
greater creativity and intelligence and develop
ideal citizenship by raising life to be in accord
with natural law and national law (see our “Edu-
cation” section). The Natural Law Party’s strong
educational focus is the true, long-term solution
to the pervasive problem of crime.

The Natural Law Party is the only political party
with a truly comprehensive, scientifically proven
strategy to reduce crime. Our approach is the
most hard-headed and hard-hitting, since it
focuses on scientifically proven programs that
work. Our prevention-oriented approach will
save the nation hundreds of billions of dollars
and prevent immeasurable anguish and suffer-
ing in the lives of millions of Americans who
are victims of crime each year.

1. See Victim Costs and Consequences: A New
Look, acomprehensive survey just published by
the National Institute of Justice (the research
branch of the Justice Department). This report
is the first to include cost estimates for reduced
qualify of life for victims. The report excludes
the $40 billion cost of running America's pris-
ons, jails, and parole and problation systems—
which would bring the total annual cost of crime
to almost $500 billion.

3. According to the National Center for Juvenile
Justice (1995), the murder rate among 14- to 17-
year-olds increased 165% during the last ten
years, and the number of arrests for violent crime
among 10- to 17-year-olds doubled. In addition,
according to USA Today (November 13, 1995,
p. 1A), the number of teenage arrests on weap-
ons charges has doubled since 1985.

4. America leads the industrialized world in mur-
ders—almost four times the annual U.S. casu-
alty rate during the Vietnam War (see Wilson,
J., Commentary, September 1994, p. 25). The
most recent FBI annual crime statistics for the
U.S. reported 23,300 murders, 102,000 forcible
rapes, 618,000 robberies, 1,120,000 aggravated
assaults, and 2,712,000 burglaries. (See Federal
Bureau of Investigation, op. cit.)

5. Moreover, U.S. Department of Justice figures
(press release, August 27, 1995) indicate that 5.1
million Americans are under some form of cor-
rectional supervision—prison, jail, parole, or
probation. Bob Dole's recent proposal to elimi-
nate parole would raise the number of citizens
in jail by almost 60%.

6. See Petersilia, J., “Crime and Punishment in
California: Full Cells, Empty Pockets, and Ques-
tionable Benefits,” CPS Brief, Berkeley, CA:
California Policy Seminars, May 1993. The high
cost of incarceration also argues against more
prisons. In 1995, the average annual cost per
maximum-security inmate in America was
$35,000 (Directory of Juvenile and Adult Cor-
rectional Depts., Institutions, and Paroling Au-
thorities 1995, Laurel, MD: American Correc-
tional Association, 1995), and the projected costs
of “three strikes and you’re out” legislation are
so staggering ($5.5 billion annually in Califor-
nia) that few states will ever implement them.

15. The most recent of these studies, a National
Demonstration Project conducted in Washing-
ton, D.C., from June 7 to July 30, 1993, tested
the efficacy of groups of experts in the Tran-
scendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi program
for reducing crime and social stress and improv-
ing the effectiveness of government. By the end
of the Project, when the group was largest,
actual crime as measured by FBI Uniform Crime
Statistics decreased sharply below the level pre-
dicted without the coherence-creating group. The
approximately 20% decrease in crime was highly
statistically significant (p = .00008). (See Insti-
tute of Science, Technology and Public Policy,

17. The Transcendental Meditation technique has
been successfully used in 28 rehabilitation pro-
grams in 15 U.S. states. Studies have shown that
the Transcendental Meditation technique is more
effective in reducing recidivism than other prison
rehabilitation programs (Journal of Criminal
Justice 15:211, 1987; International Journal of
Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice
11:111, 1987; Dissertation Abstracts Interna-
tional 43:539b, 1982). In 1987-1988, the Afri-
can nation of Senegal applied this rehabilitation
strategy nationwide. Over 11,000 Senegalese
prisoners and over 900 prison officers were
instructed in the TM technique. Recidivism
dropped dramatically, the prison population
halved, prison violence declined, and several
prisons closed while many others operated at
well below capacity. See New Horizons in Crimi-
nology and Penitentiary Science: The Maharishi

bilitation in Senagalese Prisons, Dacca: 12-13

21. A recent meta-analysis of programs used in
the treatment of substance abuse found that those
endorsed by the Natural Law Party were highly
effective in decreasing the use of alcohol, ciga-
rettes, and a wide variety of nonprescribed drugs
(Alcoholism Treatment Quarterly 11(1/2): 13-87,
1994).
