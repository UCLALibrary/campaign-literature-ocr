birth of a newborn or to care for a family member who is ill. Clinton Opposes a proposal by
Speaker Gingrich to remove state and local government employees from coverage under the Act,

If elected, Bob Dole has pledged a very different agenda from President Clinton’s. Dole’s
plan includes regulatory “reform” that would dismantle important environmental, education and
public health programs. All of this would be done in the name of getting "government and
government employees out of our lives."

We can elect President Clinton to a second term and other candidates who share his views
about the value of government services, but we need your help. What can you do?

@ Talk to your local union representative. Find out who your local union has endorsed and why.

@ Remember to vote on November 5 for candidates who are committed to quality public services.

@ Find out which candidates in your area support Bob Dole's calls to contract out government
services, and make sure that they understand why so many Americans are opposed to it.

@ Talk to your family and friends about the importance of the upcoming election.

™@ Get involved in your local union's efforts to elect candidates to office who are committed to
improving public services.

Quality public services require appropriate funding and resources. The public employees who
provide these services deserve adequate pay and benefits for the work they do. Most of all, they
deserve recognition and respect for their important contributions, not ridicule, from all candidates
for any office.

Sincerely,

(name of state federation president)
