Steve Forbes, CP: Ss ro] e 7.

And I want government off the back of the American
people.

That's a key difference between Pat and me -- and one
that is key to this family debate on how our movement will
lead America.

The Wall Street Journal editorial page noted Friday
that Pat is the only "Presidential candidate in the field
proposing a tax increase‚Äù in the form of a gigantic boost in
tariffs -- 40 percent in some cases.

You know, much as I like Pat, he grew up and has
spent most of his career in Washington. Isn't it typical of
someone who has been in Washington too long, to think
that the way to solve problems is to raise taxes?

T want taxes to go down, not up. My tax policies will
allow the American people to earn more, keep more of
what they earn and have more control over their lives. It
would move away from government being in charge, and
put individuals back in charge of their lives.

Those in our Party tempted by the siren cal! of
Statism, should remember the fundamental tenet of
conservative philosophy. It is not government that grants
us our rights and our freedoms. As it says in the
Declaration of Independence, our rights are granted by
God Almighty, and it is the duty of Government never to
take away the gift God has freely given to humankind.
