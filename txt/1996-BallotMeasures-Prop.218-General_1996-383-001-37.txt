FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

JUDGE RULES IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 218 PROPONENTS —
REJECTS OPPOSITION ARGUMENTS

A Sacramento Superior Court Judge today ruled that certain ballot
arguments against Proposition 218, The Right to Vote on Taxes Act, are
false and misleading.

Superior Court Judge James T. Ford, deciding in favor of Proposition
218 proponents, made seven changes to the opponents’ ballot arguments.
In addition Judge Ford rejected all arguments brought by the opposition
against the Attorney General’s title and summary, and against the
proponents’ ballot arguments.

After the hearing, Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association, claimed victory saying, “Politicians and special interest groups
will not derail our effort to make governments cooperate with residents on
new taxes. Today’s ruling will prevent voters from being misled by our
opponents.”

If approved by voters this. November, the Right to Vote on Taxes Act
will guarantee taxpayers the right to vote on new taxes; require the
approval of property owners for new assessments on property; and limit the
use of fees.

Richard Gann, president of Paul Gann’s Citizens Committee, who
attended the hearing said, “If the opposition thought that they could walk
into Judge Ford’s chambers and mislead California voters by changing the
way the ballot title and summary were written, they were sorely mistaken.”

The Right to Vote on Taxes Act is co-sponsored by the Howard
Jarvis Taxpayers Association, Paul Gann’s Citizens Committee, and the
Alliance of California Taxpayers and Involved Voters. The act is an
amendment to the California Constitution that qualified for the November
ballot by turning in over 1 million signatures.
