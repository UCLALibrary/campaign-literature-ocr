Get Special Interest Money Out of Politics

Dear California Voter:

On November Sth, you have an opportunity to
stop the special interests by passing the toughest
campaign finance reform law in the country:
Proposition 212.

Proposition 212 will:

Force candidates for political office to
raise money from the people they
represent.

80% of California legislatorsâ€™ campaign money
comes from outside their districts. Prop. 212 forces
candidates to talk to the people they represent, by
making them raise at least 75% of their funds
from their own constituents.

Put ordinary voters ahead of special
interests and the super-rich.

97% of campaign cash comes from wealthy people
and businesses contributing over $100. Over half
of the $200 million raised by state politicians in

the last election came from only 500 donors. Prop.
212 gives ordinary voters a chance, by limiting
contributions to $100
