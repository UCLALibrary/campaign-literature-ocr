Tony is part of a movement of ordinary
Americans getting involved. He's no career
politician. He'll fight for us in Sacramento.
He's running to solve local problems: crime,

decaying neighborhoods and failing schools..

His interests are our interests.”

by the people, for the people...

I had lost my faith in the government's ability
to solve problems. Tony Cardenas is renewing that
faith. He comes from the grass roots of our
neighborhoods. He'll write tough new laws in
Sacramento to keep criminals off our streets, stop
gang violence, and fight “slum lords”. Local citizens
can make a difference. Tony Cardenas is living proof.”
