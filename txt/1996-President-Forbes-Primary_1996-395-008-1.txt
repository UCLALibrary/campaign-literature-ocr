FORBES FPORZPRESTD ENT

Dear Fellow Americans:

sn’t it time to break the lock-grip that the

political class in Washington has on so much of

our lives?

America needs a new vision, one that relies

on the values of family, faith and freedom. We
need policies that expand opportunity for all Americans
by releasing the vast growth potential locked inside the
American economy.

I am running for President because I believe the
American people share the same desire for an end to
politics as usual. I believe that they share the same
vision of an unshackled future, a future that embraces all the wonderful opportunities in
the new economy.

We are like the greatest marathon runner in the world, but we're trying to compete
with two 50-pound cinder blocks chained to our legs. It’s time to remove the dead weight
of Washington, and let the American economy run free.

That’s why this outsider is running for President. And that’s why I’m proposing to
take power away from the Washington politicians and give it back to the American
people, where it belongs.
