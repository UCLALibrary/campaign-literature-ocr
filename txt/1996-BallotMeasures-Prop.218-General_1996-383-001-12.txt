(1) "Special benefit" means a particular and distinct benefit over and
above general benefits conferred on real property located in the
district or to the public at large. General enhancement of
property value does not constitute "special benefit."

SEC. 3. Property Taxes, Assessments, Fees and Charges Limited.

[Annotation: This section provides an exclusive list of those levies which can be
imposed on property]

(a)

No tax, assessment, fee or charge shall be assessed by any agency
upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of
property ownership except:

(1) The ad valorem property tax imposed pursuant to Article XIII and
Article XIIIA of this Constitution.

(2) Any special tax receiving a two-thirds vote pursuant to Article
XIIIA, Section 4 of this Constitution.

[Annotation: Proposition 218 permits special taxes with a two-thirds vote consistent
with Proposition 13. Although there remain significant policy issues with respect to
any non-ad valorem property tax, the authors of Proposition 218 realized it would be
difficult to repeal existing statutory authorization for special taxes on property as long
as those taxes secured the requisite two-thirds vote.]

(b)

[Annotation:

(3) | Assessments as provided by this Article.

(4) Fees or charges for property related services as provided by this
Article.

For purposes of this Article, fees for the provision of electrical or gas
service shall not be deemed charges or fees imposed as an incident of
property ownership.

Such services, even when provided by a public entity, are usually

metered and, therefore, probably meet the ‘cost of service” requirements of this
initiative. Therefore, they were exempted from application.]
