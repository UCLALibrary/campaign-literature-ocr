And he concluded, "We have to change the human
heart."

Well, as Pat said, that's exactly my position -- the
position I have held all along -- which should be the
position of all our candidates: I oppose abortion. Abortion
is wrong, it's a terrible tragedy for the unborn, for women,
for families and for our country. We want to make it
vanish from our land.

But as Pat said, we are going to have to change the

-culture before we can change the law.

As my friends Senators Humphrey and Wallop have
‘said to me, they have perfect voting records on this issue,
year in and year out, they have held the line -- but it has

not advanced the cause. Instead the legal protections of life
have been steadily eroded. That is why, while we work to
\change hearts and minds, we must move immediately to
‘do those things that we can with the stroke of a
presidential pen -- end all federal funding of abortion; end
fetal tissue research; end partial-birth and late-term
abortions; support alternatives for single mothers who
would carry their child to term; stand firmly beside the
great moral authority of the Pope in international
conferences; send to those conferences articulate,
committed advocates of life like Ralph Reed; and, as I
have said many times before, appoint justices like Justice
Scalia to the Supreme Court.
