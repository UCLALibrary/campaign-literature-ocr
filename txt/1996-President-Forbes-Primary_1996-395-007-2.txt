Steve For AC Speech 7

In 1996, we once again stand at a crossroads. It is
still a time for choosing in America.

And that’s why I’m running for president.

It’s no secret that I didn’t originally intend to enter
this race; it was my hope that some other candidate would
take up the banner held high by Ronald Reagan in the
glory days of conservatism in the 1980s of economic
growth and opportunity, the philosophy summed up by
President Reagan in three short, but all important words.
Faith. Family. Freedom.

But as the months went by, and for reasons of their
own the others withdrew their names from consideration;
when there was no one else to lift up that banner, only
then did I decide to enter this contest.

I realized that I would not have the luxury of cheering
from the bleachers, that I would have to get out onto the
playing field. :

It was too late to join the race, the experts said. What
chance did a neophyte have against experienced
politicians, experienced campaigners? What chance did I
have with no organization, no party big-wigs on my team?

Though since then, I’m glad to say, I have been
joined by two conservative leaders, who have been part of
the conscience of the movement and of the Party, men
whose entire careers have been dedicated to strong values
and a strong America. I welcome my friends Senator
Gordon Humphrey and Senator Malcolm Wallop.
