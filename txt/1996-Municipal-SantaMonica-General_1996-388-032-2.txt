I Spy, You Spy a
Councilmember

Police say the councilman [Kelly
} Olsen] unwittingly drove his white
truck through the middle of a police
undercover narcotics surveillance
operation. Moreover, Olsen was
driving on a pedestrian-only beach
access road at the time. Olsen says
the police have the wrong man. That
puts the councilman at odds with a
lieutenant, a sergeant and several
other Santa Monica Police officers

Santa Monicans for Renters’
Rights leaders reject Kelly Olsen

(From a letter circulated at the 1996 SMRR Convention)

We do not believe that there are four
candidates who seek our endorsement
who are qualified by experience or
temperament to carry our banner...
For a variety of reasons we do not
believe that Kelly Olsen and Richard
Bloom should be among those
endorsed by SMRR.
