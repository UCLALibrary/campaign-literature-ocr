NOTES

1. All political parties agree on the need to
reduce the national debt, and the passage of the
balanced budget amendment in the House of
Representatives in January 1995 was hailed as
the first triumph of the Republicans’ Contract
with America. But the failure of the amendment
in the Senate underscored its inadequacies as a
fiscal policy: much government spending
remained exempt; noncompliance was virtually
assured by legislative overrides; and a shift in
the tax burden could mask large deficits in gov-
ernmental operations. Most important, the
amendment failed to address the underlying,
costly social problems that have driven deficit
spending.

2. According to the U.S. Census Bureau (1995),
14.5% of all Americans live below the poverty
level. Many Americans go hungry, and many are
homeless.

3. In its January 1996 report, the Kemp com-
mission provides specifics about the enormous
cost of tax compliance (Unleashing America’s
Potential: A Pro-Growth, Pro-Family Tax Sys-
tem for the 21st Century, The National Commis-
sion on Economic Growth and Tax Reform,
January 1996, p. 7):

In 1991, the Tax Foundation reported that
small corporations spent a minimum of $382
in compliance costs for every $100 they paid
in income taxes. According to 1995 L.R.S.
estimates, businesses will spend about 3.4
billion hours and individuals will spend about
1.7 billion hours embroiled in tax-related
paperwork. That means nearly three million
people—more people than serve in the U.S.
armed forces—work full time all year just to
comply with tax laws, at a cost of about $200
billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation.

6. The Natural Law Party’s flat tax proposal
maintains charitable deductions but does not
maintain the mortgage deduction. A mortgage
deduction increases the tax on all Americans by
at least 2% and unfairly penalizes those who use
their earnings for other purposes—for example,
to send their children to college. The mortgage
deduction, pushed by the housing industry,
amounts to a form of corporate welfare for that
industry. The Natural Law Party believes that
taxes should be used to finance government, not
to shape social and economic agendas by favor-
ing some businesses over others.

Our flat tax proposal would maintain charitable
deductions to promote an increase in charitable
giving. Local philanthropic activities are more
effective, more rewarding, and less wasteful than
federally administered, socialized charity. The
Natural Law Party would therefore like to see a
shift in the responsibility for charitable giving
from the government back to the individual.
More Americans will be inspired to give once
they have more wealth as a result of lower taxes
and our pro-growth economic policies.

Capital gains (indexed for inflation) and inter-
est will be taxed as normal income under the
Natural Law Party’s proposal, but double taxa-
tion (e.g., a tax on dividend income) will be
avoided.

The Natural Law Party proposes a tax floor of
$25,500 for a family of four, below which Ameri-
cans would pay no taxes. While this floor is
lower than that proposed by some others, the
Natural Law Party believes that most citizens
should contribute something to society—to our
schools, our roads, and our national security.
Most important, however, with our low 10% tax
rate, all Americans will pay significantly less tax
than they do today.

sistently shown that systematic use of diet,
exercise, and meditation, in combination, can
clear clogged arteries—promising large savings
over the average $20,000-$50,000 cost of
angioplasty and bypass surgery (see Journal of
the American Medical Association 274:894-901,
1995; Lancet 336:129-133, 1990; and American
Journal of Cardiology 69: 845-853, 1992).

In addition, a five-year study of health insurance
Statistics on over 2,000 persons practicing one
of the prevention programs endorsed by the
Natural Law Party—the Transcendental Medi-
tation program—found that their doctor visits
and hospitalizations were less than half that of
other groups of comparable age, sex, and
profession. Improvements were observed in all
disease categories, including an 87% drop in car-
diovascular illness (Psychosomatic Medicine
49:493, 1987). A longitudinal study of 677 health
insurance enrollees in Quebec showed that health
care utilization declined between 5% and 7% per
year after the subjects learned the Transcenden-
tal Meditation program (American Journal of
Health Promotion 10(3): 208-216, 1995). A
recent study on hypertension in elderly African-

Americans found that Transcendental Medita-
tion was twice as effective in reducing high blood
pressure as progressive muscle relaxation and
was comparable to medication (Hypertension 26
(5):820-827, 1995).

9. Drug and alcohol abuse cost America an esti-
mated $166 billion a year. Stress has a negative
impact on personal and corporate productivity,
and costs U.S. business $150-$200 billion each
year. See “Healthy Mind; Healthy Organiza-
tion—A Pro-active Approach to Occupational
Stress,” Human Relations 47 (4):455-471, 1994;

zation, “Stress at Work,” World Labor Report 6,

tional Labor Office, 1993.
