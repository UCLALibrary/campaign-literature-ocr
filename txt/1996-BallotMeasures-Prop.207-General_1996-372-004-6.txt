ARGUMENT

Ballot Argument in Favor of Proposition 207.
Attorneys Fees. Right to Negotiate. Frivolous Lawsuits.

KEEP YOUR CONTINGENCY FEE PROTECTION.

Nobody wants to be forced to hire a lawyer. But a
contingent fee lawyer can give you a fighting chance
against corporations and insurance company lawyers.

Lobbyists for multi-million dollar corporations and
insurance companies give money to politicians. They want
to change the law so that consumers can’t hire a

contingency fee attorney.

Yes on Proposition 207 keeps consumers’
contingency fee protections in place until the voters—not

the politicians—change them.
PROPOSITION 207 PUNISHES BAD LAWYERS.

Peauuidtion 207 was written by responsible
consumer attorneys who protect people from stock
swindlers, insurance companies and manufacturers of
dangerous products. It punishes the bad lawyers without
taking away consumers’ contingency fee protections.
