THE FACTS: Nobody reputable believes that. Dole’s “six percent” doesn’t include the more
than $700 billion in cuts he simply assumes from last year’s vetoed and discredited Republican
budget. Independent analyses, such as Time, Business Week, and the nonpartisan Concord
Coalition say that Dole's plan will require between one-third to 40% cuts in domestic
discretionary programs in 2002. Time magazine wrote: "[A]nalysts say agencies from the FBI to
the Transportation Department could face cuts as deep as 40%...(including 300,000 fewer
children in Head Start, 2,200 fewer park rangers; 2,170 fewer Border Patrol agents, 2,960 fewer
DBA staff)." [Time, 9/23/96]

ATTACK: _ "...The largest tax increase in the history of America."

THE FACTS: Wrong. Every serious observer agrees that the 1982 tax increase written by
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Dole is the largest in history. New York Times,
11/3/95: “It is not true that the $240 billion tax increase approved by Congress in 1993 at Mr.
Clinton's behest is the largest in American history. When adjusted for inflation -- the only way
to make comparisons of dollar amounts from different years -- a tax increase engineered by Mr.
Dole in 1982, when he was the chairman of Senate Finance Committee, was larger.”
Unbelievably, Dole wanted an even bigger tax increase: He said, in an address on the Senate
floor, “Last year, the tax cut was too big, and this year the tax increase is too small.”
[Congressional Record, S-21869, 1982]

CLAIMS: “I have had a consistent record [on tobacco] since 1965.”

THE FACTS: Consistently wrong on tobacco. The bill that Dole voted for in 1965 — the so-
called “Cigarette Labeling Act” -- was considered a “victory for the cigarette industry” according
to Congressional Quarterly because it superceded regulations by the Federal Trade Commission,
which would have required health warnings in cigarette advertising on radio, television,
newspapers and other media. The bill that passed required health warnings only on cigarette
packages and cartons, not advertising. [1965 CQ Almanac, vt. 90, p. 978, 7/13/65; 1965 CO
Almanac, p. 344]. After taking almost $500,000 in campaign contributions, Bob Dole opposes
President Clinton’s efforts to curb teen smoking. He has questioned whether smoking is
addictive and compared the danger of smoking to the dangers of drinking milk. When he was
attacked by former Surgeon General Koop for his statements, Dole said Koop had been
brainwashed “a little bit” by the liberal media. [Washington Post, 6/22/96; AP, 6/20/96; ABC’s
“World News Tonight,” 6/14/96; NBC, “Today,” 7/2/96, FEC, Better America Foundation

ATTACK: “Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America.”

THE FACTS: President Clinton has fought the drug war on all fronts. Casual drug use is down
