BACKGROUNDER

Other States’ Medical Marijuana Laws

If Proposition 215 passes, California will not be the first state to protect
seriously and terminally ill people who use marijuana for medical purposes.

¢ Ohio is the most recent state to create a legal defense for medical
marijuana patients. The legislature passed a bill in 1995 that took
effect July 1, 1996. Patients in Ohio can now, with the recom-
mendation of their physician, legally use marijuana. If arrested and
prosecuted, they can defend themselves against marijuana charges
by proving medical need — just like Prop. 215 will work here.

¢ Recent cases in the Supreme Courts of Florida and Idaho ensured
that medical marijuana-using patients are exempt from criminal
penalties. Case law in some states has evolved to permit “medical
necessity” defenses by patients charged with using marijuana
illegally, if they can prove they had a medical reason to do so.
Washington State and the District of Columbia have also
recognized this defense for medical marijuana patients.

¢ Washington State and Massachusetts both acted in 1996 to create
new medical marijuana research programs. On March 30,
Washington allocated $130,000 to two different studies on the
medical use of marijuana; one would examine cultivation
methods, the other would look at medicinal efficacy. A
Massachusetts law enacted August 8 orders state public health
authorities to design regulations for a medical marijuana study.

Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have passed some form
of legislation to support the medical use of marijuana. Such legislation has
included resolutions urging action by the federal government, bills to
reclassify marijuana under state law to permit its medical use, bills to create
therapeutic research programs using marijuana, and bills to create legal
defenses for patients using marijuana under a doctor's order.

CONCLUSION: While Proposition 215 is the first attempt to protect medical
marijuana-using patients by initiative, its passage would give California
patients a legal tool — an affirmative defense against marijuana charges —
already available to patients in at least four states (Ohio, Florida, Idaho and
Washington State) and the District of Columbia.
