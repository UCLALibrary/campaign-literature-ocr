OVER ONE MILLION SIGNATURES SUBMITTED TO QUALIFY
RIGHT TO VOTE ON TAXES ACT FOR NOVEMBER BALLOT

A coalition of taxpayer groups headed by the Howard
Jarvis Taxpayers Association has turned in 1,060,000
signatures today (22) to qualify for the ballot an initiative
to protect local taxpayers. If approved by voters this
November, the Right to Vote on Taxes Act will guarantee

taxpayers the right to vote on new taxes, require the

approval of property owners for new assessments on property,
and limit the use of fees.

"The Right to Vote on Taxes Act will force local
governments to work cooperatively with citizens on the issue
of new taxes," said Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Association.

The Right To Vote on Taxes Act is being qualified as an
amendment to the California Constitution. Official
certification of the taxpayers’ initiative by the secretary
of state is expected by June.

Co-proponents of the Right to Vote on Taxes are Paul
Gann's Citizens Committee and the Alliance of California
Taxpayers and Involved Voters.
