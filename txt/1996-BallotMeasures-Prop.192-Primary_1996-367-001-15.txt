Nowhere is that damage more critical than to the most vulnerable elements of our

transportation system -- bridges and highway overpasses.

Eight major bridges and over 1,000 highway bridge crossings critically need strengthening

and repair to assure they will not collapse in the next earthquake.

Proposition 192 deserves your Yes vote because:

e EARTHQUAKE REINFORCEMENT WORKS. Every bridge strengthened in Southern
California with state-of-the-art technology came through the Northridge quake intact,

keeping emergency relief and commerce flowing.

e DISASTER RECOVERY IS IMPROVED. When highways or freeways are seriously
damaged in earthquakes, problems are not just limited to the areas of damage. An
entire system used by tens of thousands: of motorists is paralyzed for miles around,
obstructing firefighters, rescue workers and relief supplies. And it undermines our

stateâ€™s economy for years.

e EVERY CALIFORNIAN WILL BENEFIT. Funds for critically needed highway and
passenger rail projects throughout California are being shifted to pay for earthquake
safety repairs. Proposition 192 will ensure that important highway and rail safety,
repair and construction projects will not be delayed or eliminated. Proposition 192

will help revitalize our economy by creating jobs.
