BALLOT MEASURE LAUNCHED TO PROTECT LOCAL TAXPAYERS
Beleaguered by new taxes on utilities or assessments on property?

A coalition of taxpayer groups has launched a campaign to qualify an initiative for the
ballot to protect local taxpayers. If approved by the voters, the Right to Vote on Taxes Act
will guarantee taxpayers the right to vote on new taxes and assessments and limit the use of
fees.

Petitions to place the Right to Vote on Taxes Act before the voters are being
circulated and distributed by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, Paul Gann’s Citizens
Committee and the Alliance of California Taxpayers & Involved Voters.

The Right to Vote on Taxes Act will:

* Strengthen existing law to require all new local taxes — like utility user taxes — be
submitted to voters for approval.

* Require a majority vote of property owners to approve all new assessments on
property.

+ Require existing assessments on property — that do not directly benefit
property — be ratified by a majority of property owners.

* Strictly limit the use of fees and charges imposed on property owners.

* Provide local voters the right to use the initiative to make changes in local laws
governing taxes, fees, assessments and charges.

In the past, local governments have attempted to get around the tax limitation
provisions of Proposition 13 by calling new taxes by other names like “assessments” and
“fees.” Taxpayer representatives say the Right to Vote on Taxes Act will prevent governments
from playing games with words to avoid allowing the people to vote on taxes.

“To get on the November ballot we will need to gather nearly a million signatures by
April,” said Jarvis Association president Joel Fox. “We are asking every concerned
taxpayer to sign and circulate a petition.”

Those interested in signing or circulating a petition to place the Right to Vote on Taxes
Act on the ballot can call or write the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, 621 S.
Westmoreland, Ste. 202, Los Angeles 90005, phone (213)384-9656, or Paul Gann's Citizens
