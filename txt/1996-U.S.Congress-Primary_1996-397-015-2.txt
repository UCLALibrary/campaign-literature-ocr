Dear Friend,

The horrible acts of terrorism we have seen in recent days have
convinced us that now, more than ever, it is absolutely essential
that we send a leader to Washington who will continue to fight for
the protection and preservation of the State of Israel.

Jeff Lipow is the only candidate in this race who is talking about
the State of Israel and the other problems we, as Jews, are facing.

We are writing to urge you to support Jeff Lipow in the Democratic
primary on Tuesday March 26th.

Jeff Lipow was born in the 24th Congressional district, attended
public schools in the district and was Bar Mitzvahed in the District
at Beth Hayim in Sherman Oaks. Jeff currently resides in Encino
with his wife and two children. Jeff Lipow has a long history of
community volunteerism and service in the Jewish community.

No other candidate has spoken out sO passionately for Israel and
the Jewish community. Just last week Jeff held a news conference
to demand tough action in response to the 53% rise in anti-Semitic
hate crimes reported last year in the San Fernando Valley.

Jeff Lipow supports continued aid to Israel, and the use of
American power and influence to thwart terrorism and promote
the peace process.

Israel again needs our help. They are counting on leaders in the
United States to explore new ways to help protect peace and fight
terrorism in their country. We have a chance next week to choose

such a leader.

Please vote for Jeff Lipow for Congress.
