invasion of Kuwait -- Dole tried to weaken the same sanctions. In December, 1990, he equated
Israel’s actions to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait when he suggested that Israel may have to give
up the Occupied Territories as part of a solution to the Gulf crisis. Sources: Congressional

ATTACK: “It’s his trustees, the President’s trustees, not mine, who say it’s going
broke. He doesn’t fix it for ten years.”

THE FACTS: President Clinton’s balanced budget extends the life of the Trust Fund for a
decade -- the same as the Republican budget plan. (Letter from Medicare Chief Actuary, 6/4/96.]
The 1993 Clinton Economic Plan, opposed by Senator Dole and enacted without a single
Republican vote, extended the life of the Trust Fund by 3 years. [Medicare Actuary, 3/28/95]
Republicans, who in 1995 tried to cut Medicare by $270 billion, don’t even believe in the
program: Senator Bob Dole said, "I was there, fighting the fight, one of twelve, voting against
Medicare in 1965 ... because we knew it wouldn't work." [American Conservative Union Speech,
10/24/95}

. ATTACK: “The President...devastated states like California.”

THE FACTS: Californians are clearly better off than they were four years ago. After
California’s unemployment rate had increased from 5.0 percent to 9.7 percent during the Bush
Administration, the unemployment rate in California has fallen from 9.7 percent to 7.0 percent.
[Bureau of Labor Statistics, 10/96] After California lost 57,900 jobs during the Bush years, the
California economy has added nearly 700,000 new jobs since President Clinton took office.
[Bureau of Labor Statistics, 10/96] And consumer confidence in California has increased 56
percent since President Clinton took office. [Conference Board, 9/96]

CLAIM: “That’s not true [that Gingrich-Dole Congress wrote bills with lobbyists]”

THE FACTS: Not True? Dole’s regulatory reform bill was heavily influenced by lobbyists,
many of whom have contributed to Dole’s political efforts. According to Congressional
Quarterly, “Dole has relied closely for drafting advice on outside lobbyists, representing
businesses and trade associations, many of which have contributed to his presidential campaign
and have a direct financial interest in a lighter regulatory burden.” And, according to the New
York Times, “...seldom in the past have Congressional staff members so openly and publicly
embraced legislative outsiders with extensive interests in the outcome.” [COQ Weekly, 5/6/95, p.
1219-20; New York Times, 3/31/95}
