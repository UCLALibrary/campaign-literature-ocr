: Dear GSMOL Member:

Enclosed with this letter you will find a copy of GSMOL’s most recent analysis
of the phoney anti-rent control initiative. It is entitled: "Exposing the Fraud: The Truth, the
Whole Truth and Nothing But the Truth about the Phoney ’California Mobilehome Fairness
Initiative." PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PACKET REPLACES ANY PRIOR INITIATIVE
ANALYSIS PACKET WHICH YOU MAY HAVE RECEIVED. ALL OTHERS SHOULD BE
DISCARDED.

The packet includes three main parts:

ii The INTRODUCTION includes a brief analysis of the reasons for
mobilehome rent control and the consequences that the Initiative would have.

ya SUMMARY OF THE FRAUD examines some of the alleged benefits
which the proponents attribute to the Initiative. The reference for each claim is noted, so that
vou can read them for yourselves and refer to them if necessary. A copy of the first few pages
of the proponents’ “Background for Policy Makers” is also enclosed for your reference at
the end of this packet.

3) ANALYSIS OF THE INITIATIVE TEXT contains an update and revised
summary of the Initiative Text (on the left) along with GSMOL’s comments (on the right). The
Initiative text shown here represents the final version of the Initiative, and is different from
the text included in previous GSMOL summaries. Do not attempt to compare the two. Instead,
please discard any analysis of the Initiative which you previously received from GSMOL, and
substitute this new version in its place.

This packet is intended as a campaign tool for GSMOL members, mobilehome
owners and concerned citizens who wish to help ensure the defeat of the phoney Initiative in

March, 1996.
