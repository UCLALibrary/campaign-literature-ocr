knows our

children’s future

is more
important than

partisan politics.”

Debra Bowen believes that education is the road to
the American Dream. She is fighting for excellence in
our schools — so that every child graduates with solid
reading, writing and arithmetic skills to compete in
tomorrow’s workplace.

¢ Bowen champions school reforms — such as
the Charter Schools program-—to give teachers
and parents more control over their schools.

e Bowen works to make sure students have
current textbooks and access to computers
so they’ll be prepared for the 21st century.

¢ Bowen regularly teaches at each public high
school in her district.

¢ Bowen strongly supports laws expelling kids
who bring weapons and guns to school.

¢ Bowen helped secure $770 million to reduce
overcrowding in K-3 classes. She fights to
make sure our schools get their fair share.

Our schools need Debra Bowen in Sacramento. That’s
why, on November 5, it is critical that we re-elect
Debra Bowen to the State Assembly.
