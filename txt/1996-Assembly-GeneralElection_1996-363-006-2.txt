rink 8 glasses a day of...water. Brush your

teeth with...water. Take a shower with...

water. 98% of our bodies are made up of it.
Water is so essential to our everyday lives we can
take it for granted

Don't.

Without clean, available water, we would die.
That’s why we have tough laws to keep our water
supply safe and pure. Laws that safeguard our
environment and protect our health. Laws that
must be enforced - not repealed.

The California League of Conservation Voters
endorses only those candidates who will protect
California’s oceans, lakes and rivers - and keep
our drinking water supply safe. So the next gener-
ation of Californians can keep drinking 8 glasses
a day of clean, pure water.
