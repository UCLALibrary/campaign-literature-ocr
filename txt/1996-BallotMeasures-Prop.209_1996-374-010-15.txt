Generally, federal constitutional standards permit state
and local entities to consider race characteristics as
factors in remedying the effects of their own past
discriminatory practices in contracting and employment
where:

e The evidence of past discrimination is convincing (a
finding of general discrimination is not sufficient), and
there is a compelling governmental interest in
offsetting the record of prior discrimination;

e The consideration of racial characteristics is “narrowly
tailored” to remedy prior discrimination;

e There is a_ statistical disparity between the
composition of an entity’s labor force and the qualified
population in the relevant market.

It is less clear whether these general guidelines apply to
school admissions, scholarships and school busing because
the case law is more unsettled in the education arena. In
the leading admissions case, Regents of the University of
California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), as summarized
by Professor Varat, “a compelling interest in diversifying
a state university student body was held to justify an
admissions policy that accorded some racial preference to
certain nonwhite applicants competing for the limited
positions available in an entering class.” Evidence of
prior discrimination was not required in the Bakke case;
instead a compelling state interest in achieving diversity
was sufficient.

Voluntary Affirmative Action Plans For Private
Government Contractors

State laws have required that state agencies that contract
for goods and services have goals of providing at least 15
percent of their contracts to minority-owned businesses
and at least 5 percent to women-owned companies. Some
local governments have adopted similar “set-aside”
requirements. The proposed initiative seeks to end these
programs.
