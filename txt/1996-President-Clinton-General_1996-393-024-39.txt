The Dole Record

HIGHER EDUCATION

Pell Grants

® In 1981, Dole voted for a budget bill that slashed Pell
Grant — the federal student-aid program which is
targeted to the neediest students.

(Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1981, p. 493)

& Last year, Dole supported a budget plan (H.R. 2491)
that would have again reduced Pell Grants — denying
grants to 380,000 needy students and also reducing the
maximum grant level proposed by President Clinton by
10%.

(Committee for Education Funding, 1995)

& Besides proposed cuts in Pell Grants, the budget plan
favored by Senator Dole would have eliminated federal
“seed money” for the State Student Incentive Grants
programs. In 1993-94, for example, 650,000 students
received State Student Incentive Grants for average
amounts of $1,000.

(On Campus, September 1995)

Student Loans

® Dole voted against the Direct Lending program that
cuts out the “middle man” (banks and other commercial
lenders) from the college loan process for students and
their families. Dole now proposes to cap the program and
return to banks their profit-making role. These actions, if
passed, would have cut off direct lending to 2.5 million
students in 1996 alone.

(Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1993, vote #190)

= Last year, Dole supported the budget plan sponsored
by Newt Gingrich that would have cut Stafford Loans,
Perkins Loans and other student loan programs by $5
billion. The plan, if approved, would have reduced the
availability of student loans by nearly 1.9 million.
President Clinton vetoed the bill.

(Washington Post, 11/6/94)

The bill established a “needs test” that applied to any
students loans being applied for by families with incomes
over $30,000 a year.

(Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1981, p. 493)

(Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1965, vote #196)

National Service

@ In 1993, Dole voted against the President’s national
service program (Americorps), which provides college
scholarships to young people who volunteer at schools,
hospitals, parks or other areas of their communities.
Last year, Dole criticized the program for providing
financial aid for young people: “I thought volunteers
were volunteers.”

(Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1993; Speech in Keene, N.H., 2/18/95)

The Arts & Humanities

® Dole voted in 1994 to cut funding for the National
Endowment for the Arts from the level requested by
President Clinton. As a congressman, Dole voted in 1965
to eliminate funding for the National Council on the Arts.
In all, Dole has voted to limit or cut funding for the arts
and humanities at least seven times.

‘Science & Research

@ Under both Republican and Democratic presidents,
Dole has voted to curb funding for the National Science
Foundation. In 1992, Dole voted for a $300 million cut
in the funding level proposed by then-President Bush for
the NSF. The following year, Dole voted to cut $200
million from the NSF funding requested by President
Clinton.
