“The place to start is in the home. Parents must teach
children that there is a clear, stark difference between
right and wrong. They must teach children that people
who cross the line are punished. Actions have conse-
quences. People in American who break the law, will
be punished. And people who intentionally hurt some-
one else, will be punished severely.”
