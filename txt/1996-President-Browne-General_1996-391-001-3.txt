Government doesn't work!

overnment doesn’t keep our
communities safe. Its schools

don't educate our children.
Its welfare system promotes dependency,
irresponsibility, and poverty. And government
saps the economy — crippling and killing new
businesses and jobs.

Every income tax dollar the federal
government takes out of your paycheck is a
dollar you can’t save, spend, or donate to your
favorite charity or cause or church.

Every federal mandate, regulation,
restriction, and law imposed on you is a
decision taken out of your hands. A decision
taken out of your community.

We don’t need seven-year plans to
reform government. We need:

Huge tax cuts now. Huge spending cuts
now. A balanced budget now.

During Harry Browne’s first year as
President of the United States, he'll deliver to
Congress a budget that will:

1. Immediately slash
federal spending by 50%.

2. Immediately end

the Income Tax and shut
down the IRS.

What will Harry Browne
“replace” the Income Tax with?
A flat tax? No. A sales tax? No.

A Value Added Tax? No. He'll replace it with
nothing. The massive spending cut pays for
the tax cut.

3. Immediately balance the budget.
Harry Browne’s plan is detailed in his new
campaign book, Why Government Doesnt
Work. (Available through your local book-
store.) If the store is sold out, you can special-
order your copy.

How would this affect your life?

Look at last year’s 1040 tax form. What

would you do with the money the government

took from you — money you earned — if it
were yours to spend?

Would you put your children in
a private school that offers a
better education and teaches
your values? Would you put
your money into savings or
investments or perhaps use it

to start that business

you've always
dreamed of?
Would you move
to a better home?
Give more to your
favorite charity or
cause or church?
Leaving all
your earnings in
your hands lets

you make these choices for yourself, your
family, and your community.

How can we afford to repeal

the Income Tax immediately?

We will make the federal government much
smaller now — shrunk down to only the
activities specified in the Constitution. That
means ending all federal social programs.

What about the needy?

You — not some bureaucrat — will decide
who’s actually doing some good, who’s*
helping the needy become self-supporting,
who’s earning your charity dollar — and
how many charity dollars you'll give them.
So will your co-workers, neighbors, and
other members of your community.

Charity, not welfare. Private compas-
sion will succeed where government com-
pulsion has failed.

Decisions about education, crime
control, transportation systems, and other
issues affecting your community will be
made in your community — not in Wash-
ington, D.C. Harry Browne is the only
candidate for President committed to
returning individual choice and personal
responsibility to you.

Harry Browne is the only candi-
date for President telling Washington,
D.C.: Hands off your community. Hands off
your paycheck. Hands off your life.

Federal law requires political committees to report
the name, mailing address, and occupation and
name of employer for each individual whose contribu-
tions aggregate in excess of $200 in a calendar year.
Federal law prohibits individuals from donating more than $1,000 to a
presidential campaign. However, each member of your family can donate

$1,000 by writing a separate $1,000 check. (Provided the funds belong to the
person and the person agrees to make the donation.)
