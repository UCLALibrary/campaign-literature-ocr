“We need Bob Hertzberg in the

Assembly to
protect a woman’
right to choose.” ac

— Assemblymember Barbara Friedman

A message from
Assemblymember Barbara Friedman

am proud to have served you in the State Assembly and
am pleased with the progress | made on issues like breast
cancer research and educational reform. Now that | am
leaving office, | want to be sure that the person replacing
me will have the guts to stand up to the Radical Right
which is trying to turn back the clock on the progress
we've made.

That is why | am endorsing Bob Hertzberg.

* | trust Bob to continue fighting for women and families.
Throughout his career, Bob has been a strong voice for
choice, public safety, education and the environment.

On March 26, please join me in electing a creative,
effective leader to the State Assembly — Bob Hertzberg.

Sincerely,

Barbara Friedman
CA State Assembly
