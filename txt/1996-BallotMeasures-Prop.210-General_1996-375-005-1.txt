Facts About Proposition 210

What does Proposition 210 do?

California’s minimum wage has been set at $4.25 an hour since 1988.
Under the new federal law, the minimuni wage will increase to $4.75
an hour on October 1, 1996, and to $5.15 an hour on September 1,
1997. Proposition 210 would increase California’s minimum wage to
$5.00 an hour on March 1, 1997 and to $5.75 an hour on March 1,
1998.

Who is covered by the California minimum wage?

Under California law, all workers in private employment are covered
by the state minimum wage, except for outside salespersons and an
employer’s immediate family. State and local government employees
are covered by the federal minimum wage. State law allows payment
of no less than 85% of the minimum wage to minors and trainees.

Why increase the minimum wage?

The current minimum wage is a poverty wage. Under California law,
the minimum wage must be "adequate to supply the necessary cost of
proper living to, and maintain the health and welfare of employees in
this state" (Labor Code Section 1198.5). Throughout the 1960s and
1970s, the minimum wage was set at roughly a level that provided a
full-time worker encugh income to support 2 family of three at the
poverty line. At $4.75, a full-time minimum wage worker earns
$9840 a year. According to the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, survival for a family of three at the poverty line
requires an income of $12,980 a year, or $6.24 an hour working full-
time. Many minimum wage earners qualify for food stamps and
welfare to supplement their pay.

The current minimum wage punishes hard work. Even with the
pending increase to $4.75, since 1988 California’s minimum wage has
lost over 14 per cent of its value due to inflation.'! In 1996, the
California minimum wage reached a forty year low in purchasing
power.”
