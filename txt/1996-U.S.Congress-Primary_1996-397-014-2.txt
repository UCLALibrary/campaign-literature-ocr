“It all began when I was 3 years old and a neighbor entered
me in the Ted Mack Amateur Hour.”

No one imagined that the 3-year old Barry Gordon, who ran around the block singing to his Albany

neighbors, was about to begin a successful show business career.

But people were so taken with Barry’s angelic voice and ear-to-ear grin, that by the age of 7, Barry
had appeared on TV with Jackie Gleason and Milton Berle, and had recorded the hit record, “(I’m
Getting) Nuttin’ for Christmas.” At 13, Barry won his most famous role as Nick in the classic “A

Thousand Clowns” — which he played on Broadway and in the film.

Barry has never stopped working in show business. As an adult, Barry is best known for his roles in

“Fish” and “Archie Bunker’s Place.”

By age 5, Barry had appeared in variety shows Barry GorDoN

with entertainers like Jackie Gleason, Teddy
Buckner, Milton Berle and Steve Allen.
