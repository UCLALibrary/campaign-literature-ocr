°° WARNING e

Lawyer Adam Schiff is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in a desperate attempt to buy
a seat in the State Senate. The money is being given to him by opponents of Proposition 187 —
the same people who will own his vote if he is elected. Don’t be fooled by Adam Schiff and don't
be mislead by his false charges against his opponent, respected Assemblywoman Paula Boland.

The people who wrote and supported Proposition 187 support Paula Boland for State Senate.
That's a fact even lawyer Adam Schiff can’t distort.
