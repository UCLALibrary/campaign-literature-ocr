Steve Forbe AC ch 3.

I want a flat tax that is a tax cut -- to get America
moving again, at twice the rate it is today. We did it in
the 1980s. We can do it again.

Under Pat's program, the American economy would
be called "Dead Man Walking”...under mine, it would be
"Chariots of Fire.”

Every other candidate in this race has accepted the
liberal notion that tax cuts produce deficits. They have
tied themselves to the ball and chain of static analysis that
means the American people can never escape hard labor in
tax prison. Well, I plan to set them free.

In my administration, we will have a second
Independence Day -- April 15th!

As Ronald Reagan did in 1980, I say we should cut
taxes even as We insist on cutting spending. We've already
. seen what Newt Gingrich and the freshman Republican
class have meant to America. It's time to put a President
who is a dedicated tax cutter on their side.

Vibrant economic growth -- that's how we raise
incomes... that's how we make jobs more secure... that's
how we give America's working families a brighter future.
And as for the deficit, growth will unlock us from
that prison, too. If we had continued to grow at the same

rate as under Ronald Reagan, the deficit would have
practically vanished by now... and the American family's
income would be the highest in our history.
