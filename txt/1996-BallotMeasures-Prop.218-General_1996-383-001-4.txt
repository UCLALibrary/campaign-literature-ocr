THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS UNDER CURRENT LAW COMPARED 10

ASSESSMENT PROCESS
UNDER CURRENT LAW
(landscaping and Lighting Act)

ASSESSMENT PROCESS
UNDER PROPOSITION 218
(The Right to Vote on Taxes Act)

NO ELECTION IS
REQUIRED.

However, property owners
subject to the proposed
assessment may file a
written PROTEST against
the assessment with the
local agency. The local
agency is NOT required to

supply a protest form.

REQUIRED. The local
agency mails out ballots to

those cligible to vote.

Only PROPERTY
OWNERS may file a

protest. This includes

nonresident property

owners. Renters may not

protest an assessment.

All Property Owners subject

to the assessment may vote.

Renters may vote if directly

liable to pay the assessment.

Protest are WEIGHTED
according to the AREA OF
ASSESSABLE LAND (size

of the parcel).

Ballots are WEIGHTED
according to the AMOUNT
OF ASSESSMENT PAID.

THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS UNDER PROPOSITION 218

The local agency cannot levy
the assessment if written
protests filed represent
Property owners owning,
more than 50% of the
TOTAL area of assessable
lands within the proposed

assessment district.

The local agency cannot
levy the assessment if

more than 50% of those
SUBMITTING ballots

oppose the assessment.

Under current law, if property
owner does not file a written
protest (i.Â¢., does nothing), it is
counted as though the owner
SUPPORTS the assessment.
This inequity makes it NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE to block an

assessment.

Under Proposition 218, if a
property owner does not submit
a ballot (i.c., doesn't vote), it
counts neither for nor against
the proposed assessment. The
outcome is based only on those
ballots actually SUBMITTED.
This is a more reasonable stan-
dard which will make it easier to

block an assessment.
