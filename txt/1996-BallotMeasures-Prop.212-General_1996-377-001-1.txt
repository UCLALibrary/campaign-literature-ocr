YES on 212

On November 5th, we can stop the special
interests from buying elections with their
out-of-district money.

Proposition 212 forces candidates for
political office to raise at least 75% of
their campaign contributions from
constituents. That means they'll have
to listen more to you, not to the big donors
who live outside your district.

Prop. 212 also limits contributions to $100,
- bans corporate contributions, eliminates
the tax deduction for lobbying expenses,
bans gifts from lobbyists to legislators, and
imposes mandatory spending.limits.

Another measure onthe ballot, Proposition
208, does none of these things.

Prop. 212 cuts carpetbagger cash. Prop.
208 doesn't.

Vote YES on 212. Vote NO on 208.
