Because Bob Hertzberg Gets Results In The Fight Against Crime.

Bob Hertzberg doesn’t just talk about fighting crime — he gets results.
As an Executive Board member of the Los Angeles Alliance for a Drug
Free Community, Bob works with law enforcement and local
neighborhoods to rid our streets of drug dealers. He fought to put
1,000 more police on patrol and to improve 9-1-1 services in our city.

As our next Assemblymember, Bob will take a comprehensive
approach to fighting crime. He will balance tough sentencing with
innovative gang and drug prevention programs, sensible gun controls,
and community-based policing. Bob will assign a staff person to help
coordinate and expand Neighborhood Watch Programs.

No wonder organizations representing over 70,000 rank-and file police
officers are supporting Bob Hertzberg for State Assembly.
