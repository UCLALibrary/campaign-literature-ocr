Professors Grodin and Varat thought the ban would be
constitutional on its face. However they both saw the ban
as unconstitutional if applied to affirmative action pl

that had been instituted because of past discrimination by

public entities.

Professor Landsberg viewed the ban as unconstitutional

on its face and as applied, when there has been _past

discrimination.

Professor Chemerinsky concluded the ban probably would

be unconstitutional as applied. when there is evidence of
past discrimination. ;

If a court found the ban unconstitutional on its
face, then the court would invalidate it under all
circumstances. If the court found the ban
unconstitutional as applied to the facts of a
particular case, then the ban could be applied
constitutionally in other situations.

The proposed initiative includes a severance clause,
subsection (g), which states that if a portion of the
initiative is ruled invalid, its other provisions would
stand. Thus, the court would invalidate any provisions
ruled unconstitutional and would uphold any provisions
found constitutional.

Validity, on Its Face, of the Ban on Preferential
Treatment

Three major arguments were employed by the
constitutional law experts to test the validity, on its face,
Â». of the ban on preferential treatment in Section 31 (a).
These arguments are briefly summarized below. All of
the scholars believed the most persuasive argument
challenging the ban would involve an interpretation of
Washington v. Seattle School District 458 U.S. 457 (1982)
and related cases. Among those is Evans v. Romer, now
pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.
