It is quite clear now that current law, by prohibiting all proactive management
techniques, has left California’s elected officials and wildlife experts without the flexibility to
adapt to changes in the state’s mountain lion population and helpless to respond to a growing
threat to public safety.

SB 28 enjoys strong support from agricultural interests, including the California
Chamber of Commerce, the California Farm Bureau, the California Cattlemen’s Association
and the California Woolgrowers Association, as well as victims’ groups and law enforcement
representatives. The bill passed both houses with bipartisan support and was signed into law
by Governor Pete Wilson, Chapter 779, Statutes of 1995. It will soon be assigned a
proposition number by the Secretary of State and will appear on the March 1996 ballot.

There has been rampant speculation that the bill, as it will appear on the March 1996
ballot, authorizes the Department of Fish and Game to allow sport hunting of the lions. It
should be noted that this is not the case; the ballot measure does not specify which
management tools the Department should use to manage the mountain lion population. In
fact, the bill even prohibits the Department from using any new management tools or methods,
including a hunting season, until the Department has completed its study of the species,
prepared a management plan, submitted that management plan to the State Fish and Game
Commission and the Fish and Game Commission has held public hearings to discuss and
decide on all or part of the options outlined in the management plan.
