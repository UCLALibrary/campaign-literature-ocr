SMOKE ALREADY BLOWING AWAY FROM PROPOSITION 207

Sacramento, CA...With 10 weeks remaining before the November 5 election, the smoke
is already blowing away from the trial lawyers’ attempt to prohibit future legislative

oversight of their contingency fees and contracts. fe

a ah Pe, a: ee?

The respected California Journal in its just-published September issue summarizes that:
“Proposition 207 would protect attorneys’ ability to charge virtually unlimited contingency
fees and make it difficult for the Legislature to put a cap on such fee arrangements.” (see
attached)

John H. Sullivan, president of the Association for California Tort Reform and chair of the
Coalition Against Unfair Attorneys’ Fees, the committee formed to defeat Proposition
207, said:

“Tt is ironic that within months of changing their name to ‘consumer attorneys,’ the trial
lawyers launched a second fraud on the public by drafting this anti-consumer initiative
disguised as limits on frivolous lawsuits and excessive attorney fees.

“Their so-called ‘limits’ either restate existing rules or are written to be totally ineffective.
Voters will recognize that letting the trial lawyers write laws on frivolous lawsuits is like
letting Dracula run the blood bank,” Sullivan said.

ees" has been formed by the Association
for California Tort Reform, and is building a broad coalition to oppose the

measure.

Background:

Proposition 207 was originally intended for the March 1996 ballot as a direct counter to
Proposition 202 limiting attorney fees. Signatures were submitted past the deadline for

the March ballot, and the measure “rolled over" to the next election where it still would
have served to negate 202 had it passed. It also would have been "matched up" against
an attorney fee restriction measure that was headed for the November ballot until its
proponent decided not to file the signatures. In this context, the initiative can be
likened to an unretrieved land mine from a prior war. But it has serious implications

for future policy-making.
