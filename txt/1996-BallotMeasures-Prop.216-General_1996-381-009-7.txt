Registered Nurses at the UCLA Medical Center will engage in
informational picketing at the facility on Thursday, August 15,
1998).

The demonstration is set from 11:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. at the main
entrance to the hospital on Le Conte and Westwood Blvd.

Nurses intend to stand firm in their protest against:

*Profit driven cost containment which results in unsafe
patient care.

*Restructuring which reduces patient-to-RN staffing ratios and
are in conflict with the mandates of the California Nursing
Practice Act.

*Lack of attention by the University to the issues that
directly affect the "quality of patient care and consumer
safety.

*The University’s threat to unilaterally impose conditions of
employment not negotiated with the nurses.

*Major take-aways dealing with wages and benefits proposed by
the University.

According to many of the UCLA nurses, UC is engaging in changes in
healthcare delivery which is detrimental to patients. Barbara
Grasso, Director of UC relations for the California “Nurses
Association has emphasized, "RNs have serious questions about some
of these proposals. As advocates for patients, RNs are in no mood
to have these changes dictated and imposed in the absence of
serious give-and-take and a good faith effort to reach a reasonable
agreement. At UCLA the number of unlicensed staff, known as care
partners, has gone from 30 to 120 in the last five years while the
number of RNs has gone from 710 to 650. In addition, UCLA is
targeting its most experienced nurses, who are earning the highest
salaries, for lay-offs which is depriving patients of an invaluable
amount of experience. These maneuvers have led to a decline in the
quality ‘of; care."
