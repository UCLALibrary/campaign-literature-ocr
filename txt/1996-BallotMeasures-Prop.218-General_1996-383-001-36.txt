RIGHT TO VOTE ON TAXES ACT QUALIFIES FOR BALLOT

The California Secretary of State has certified (14) the Right to Vote on Taxes Act for
the November 5 ballot.

If approved by voters in the fall election, the Right to Vote on Taxes Act will guarantee
taxpayers the right to vote on new local taxes, require the approval of property owners for
new assessments on property, and limit the use of fees.

“The Right to Vote on Taxes Act will close the loopholes in Proposition 13 and force
local governments to work cooperatively with citizens on the issue of new taxes,” said Joel
Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.

To give it the maximum strength in law, the Right To Vote on Taxes Act was qualified
for the ballot as an amendment to the California Constitution.

The Right to Vote on Taxes Act will:

* Strengthen existing law to require all new local taxes — like utility user taxes — be
- submitted to voters for approval.

* Require a majority vote of property owners to approve all new assessments on
property.

* Require existing assessments on property — that do not directly benefit
property — be ratified by a majority of property owners.

Strictly limit the use of fees and charges imposed on property owners.

* Provide local voters the right to use the initiative to make changes in local laws
' governing taxes, fees, assessments and charges.

A statewide survey taken last September showed that 87% of California voters want the
right to vote on new taxes.

“There is overwhelming support for our initiative at the grassroots,” said Fox. “The
people are tired of being pounded with new taxes, fees and assessments without their
consent.”

Petitions to place the Right to Vote on Taxes Act before the voters were circulated and
distributed by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, Paul Gann’s Citizens Committee
and the Alliance of California Taxpayers & Involved Voters. Taxpayers collected over a
million signatures.
