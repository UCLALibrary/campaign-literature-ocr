7. Hispanic Americans have played key roles in
Republican administrations, holding high level
positions such as: Secretary of Interior (Manuel
Lujan), Secretary of Education (Lauro Cavazos),
Drug Czar (former Governor Bob Martinez), Chief
Economist for the Department of Treasury (Antonio
Villamil) and Assistant Secretary at the Department
for Housing and Urban Development (Jim Tarro).

8. The Republican Party was the first political
party to appoint Hispanic women to key policy
making positions such as Chairman of a House
Subcommittee (Representative Illeana Ros-
Lehtinen), U.S. Surgeon General (Antonia Novello),
Assistant Secretary of Labor (Cari Dominguez),
Assistant Secretary of State (Patricia Diaz Dennis),
Assistant Secretary of Interior (Stella Guerra) and
Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Sylvia
Chavez-Long).

9. President Bush established the Commission for
Excellence in Education for Hispanic Americans.
Republicans also want to give parents the right to
choose which school their children will attend. Bill
Clinton’s daughter attends a private school, but he
opposes a school choice plan that would allow
Hispanic American families the same option.

10. Republicans recognize the sacrifices made by
Hispanic American veterans. Thirty-eight Hispanic
Americans have been accorded the Congressional
Medal of Honor, this nation’s highest military honor.
The Republican Party will never forget the unselfish
and heroic efforts of this nation’s greatest treasure:
its veterans.
