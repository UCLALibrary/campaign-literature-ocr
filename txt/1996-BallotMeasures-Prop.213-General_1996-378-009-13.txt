Biography of Ina De Long

Ina De Long has been called everything from savior to troublemaker, and the truth
is, both descriptions are true. Born in Oklahoma, De Long has spent her entire
professional life working for insurance policy holders; first as a claims specialist, then as a
Disaster Supervisor, and most recently as consumer advocate. It is in this latest
incarnation that De Long gained her fame, some would say notoriety.

In 1990, after twenty two years with State Farm Insurance, De Long shocked her
employer, and the entire insurance industry, when she resigned from her position as
Disaster Supervisor, and blew the whistle on industry practices designed to prevent
consumers from receiving the full benefit of their insurance coverage.

Since her resignation from State Farm, De Long has gone from accidental activist,
to consumer champion. She has been featured in numerous newspaper and magazine
articles, for her work in educating insurance consumers about proper claims handling. Ms.
De Long has also been profiled on Sixty Minutes, Good Morning America, and by Peter
Jennings. In 1994, the California State Legislature recognized De Long for her tireless
effort on behalf on the insured, by naming her Woman of the Year.

Currently, De Long is the President of United Policyholders, an insurance
consumer education organization which she co-founded in 1992. She continues to be in
great demand as an expert witness in insurance claims matters. De Long is also a devoted
and loving grandmother who often recharges her batteries by spending time with her six

grandchildren.
