GOP Passes 1996 Republican Party Platform
_ A Blueprint for Restoring the American Dream

The Platform Committee of the 1996 Republican National Convention today
passed a final draft of the Republican Party Platform. Standing in stark contrast to the
failed Clinton record, the Republican Party Platform outlines the Dole agenda for a better
America with more opportunities, smaller government and stronger and safer families.

The Platform document brings together the views of Republicans from around the
country and reflects the common agenda for America’s fixture. Some key provisions:

ECONOMIC GROWTH & JOBS
The Republican Party reaffirms its commitment to creating a growing economy in
which good new jobs are created for all Americans by pledging to implement 2 simple, fair
tax system that is pro-growth and pro-family. Republicans seek a dramatically downsized
Internal Revenue Service that is less burdensome and less intrusive.

Underscoring the Republican acknowledgment that deficits are created not because
the American people are under-taxed, but because government spends too much. The
platform calls for:

A 15% across-the-board cut to marginal tax rates;

A $500 per child tax credit;

Repeal of the 1993 Clinton tax hike on Social Security benefits,

A 50% reduction of the top tax rate on capital gains to spur investment, and
Expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and establishment of spousal
IRAs to encourage and investment.

A BALANCED BUDGET
The platform maintains that a balanced budget and lower taxes go hand-in-hand.
Therefore, the platform calls for a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget.
An end to the deficit will once again make it possible for all Americans to realize the
American Dream.
