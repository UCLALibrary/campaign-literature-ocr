SO WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT PAULA BOLAND FROM

THIS BLIZZARD OF SLICK MAIL?

1. Paula Boland doesn’t seem to like Adam Schiff very much.
Paula Boland has done nothing but sling mud. Just about every brochure

Paula Boland has sent out has been a vicious partisan attack on Adam Schiff.

2. Paula Boland has told us nothing about her or her beliefs.
Paula has been so busy insulting Adam that she must have forgotten to
tell our community about who she is, what’s she’s done, or what she

stands for.

3. Paula Boland has told us nothing about what she will do if elected.
Other than continuing her 20-year long fight to break-up the City of Los
Angeles, Paula Boland has not said one word about what she plans to do

if elected. Can you name a single thing Paula Boland wants to do?

4. Paula Boland must be getting a lot of money from somewhere.
All this attack mail is expensive! Boland’s multi-million dollar campaign is
being paid for by cigarette companies, oil companies, the National Rifle

Association, and extremist right-wing PACs from Orange County.

5. Paula Boland doesn’t seem to be able to distinguish fact from fantasy.
Boland’s mail is not only negative — it’s wrong. On virtually every issue,
she has twisted, distorted or out-and-out lied about Schiff’s positions. No
wonder she is being sued for libel by her Republican primary opponent,

Bob Oltman — and a Judge has ruled that Oltman is likely to win.

PAULA BOLAND’S CYNICAL NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN IS AN
INSULT TO OUR INTELLIGENCE.

WE DESERVE BETTER THAN PAULA BOLAND. MUCH BETTER.
