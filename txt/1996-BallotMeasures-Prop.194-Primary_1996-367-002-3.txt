wages and sources of non-wage income (including benefits mandated by SB 224).
Also, in contrast to the larger study, we rely on causal models of behavior
rather than a quasi-experimental design that minimizes the importance of
developing such models. In short, we explore how the benefits provided by

SB 224 may have their effects.

The impact assessment of the unemployment benefits yields unambiguous .
results. In Part I below we find that ex-offenders who apply for and receive
the benefits are approximately 10% less likely to fail _on parole compared. to

ex-6ffenders who apply for but do not receive the benefits. The overall fail-

ure rate for the experimental group is about 31% and the overall failure rate

for the control group is about 41%. The disparity is not only statistically signi-

ficant, but robust to a number of competing formulations of the treatment effect.
For example, almost identical findings emerge when “failures” for property
crimes are distinguished from "failures" for person crimes 3 the program

works about equatly well for both types of offenses - There is also no evidence
that the benefits merely postpone crimes that would have been committed in

any case. Failure rates do not increase late in the followup period when

most members of the experimental group have already received all of the pay-
ments to which they are entitled. Finally, @ very conservative benefits-

costs analysis suggests that the pregram is cost-effective. Tne expected
saving for each member of the experimental group compared to each member of

the control group is about $2000. That is, the savings from preventing rein-
carceration fé: Gutweigh the costs of the unemployment benefits-by ebout

$2000 per person. Thus, for example, if 1000 ex-offenders receive benefits,

there will be an expected net savings of approximately $2 million.
