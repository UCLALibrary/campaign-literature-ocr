As we face our greatest challenges, we need all mobilehome owners to work together.
After 32 years of dedication and achievement for every mobilehome owner in California,
GSMOL is under attack. What if there were no GSMOL? I've enclosed a flier showing
what is at stake. I've also enclosed a leaflet showing why all mobilehome owners should
care about the park ownersâ€™ phony "rental assistance" initiative. Please renew your
membership today. Only your membership supports GSMOL's efforts to protect
mobilehome owners. ;

Thanks so much for your support!
