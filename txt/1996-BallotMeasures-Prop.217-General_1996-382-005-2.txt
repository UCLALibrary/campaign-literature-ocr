WHAT ARE THE TOP BRACKETS?

T: state’s top income tax rates—10% and 11%—are
the “top brackets.” Only the wealthiest 1% of
California taxpayers pay state income taxes in these
brackets. The brackets expire this year. A “yes” vote on
Prop. 217 will keep the top brackets in place so that
schools and communities will benefit from their revenue.
The top tax rates have been in effect all but four years
since 1973 when they were signed into law by Governor
Reagan.

The average income of filers in the two brackets is
$488,000. For filers in the highest top bracket, the
average income is almost $1 million. f

Only 169,000 taxpayers pay state income taxes in
the top brackets. Individuals with taxable incomes after
deductions of more than $230,000 and families with
taxable incomes afer deductions of $460,000 and up
are in the highest (11%) bracket. Individuals with taxable
incomes after deductions of more than $115,000 and
families with taxable incomes after deductions of
$230,000 and up are in the second-highest (10%)
bracket. .

Prop. 217 is not a tax increase—the wealthiest 1%
of taxpayers will simply continue to pay state income

taxes at the same rates they have been paying.

WHO BENEFITS?

A Il taxpayers will benefit. Schools struggling to lower
class sizes and provide quality education will
receive between $1,700 and $2,800 per 30-student
classroom. Our neighborhoods and businesses will
benefit from restored funds for local services like police
protection, firefighting, parks and libraries. Families who
have seen their taxes increase and services decline
while their paychecks remain the same will benefit from
better schools and services without an increase in
taxes.

WHO SUPPORTS PROP. 217?

P=. 217 is supported by a coalition of teachers,
taxpayers, businesses, firefighters, seniors, law
enforcement personnel, tax reform and labor
organizations, county supervisors, mayors and city
council members. Endorsers of Prop. 217 include the
California State PTA, California Professional Firefighters,
the League of Women Voters of California, Congress of
California Seniors, Peace Officers Research Association
of California, California State Association of Counties,
California Labor Federation, California Tax Reform
Association, California Teachers Association, California
Federation of Teachers, and State Superintendent of
Public Instruction Delaine Eastin.

WHO OPPOSES PROP. 217?

Tr California Chamber of Commerce and National
Federation of Independent Business, whose
members include the state’s wealthiest taxpayers,
oppose the initiative. Without Prop. 217, a total of about
169,000 taxpayers out of roughly 14 million, or about
1%, would get a $700 million tax cut at the expense of
our schools and communities.
