Victory ‘96

The Coordinated Campaign of the California Democratic Party

WHY WE’RE HERE

This newsletter has several purposes; first among them is keeping in touch with you. California is vital to
President Clinton’s re-election and regaining a majority in the House of Representatives. Maintaining our State
Senate majority and winning back a majority in the State Assembly are critical. Tell us what you’ve done or plan to
do, and let us spread the word. Let us know what kind of information and.articles you would like to see in this
publication.

Don’t let a campaign appearance by Dole or one of his surrogates go by without a well organized response.

Look around your area for direct evidence of Clinton Administration achievements that can be used to support the

campaign. Let us know how your economy, schools, hospitals and public service have been helped by the
Administration.
