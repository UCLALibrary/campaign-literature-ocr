e EVERY CALIFORNIAN WILL BENEFIT Funds for critically needed highway and
passenger rail projects throughout California are being shifted to pay for
earthquake safety repairs. If Prop. 192 fails, projects in the State Transportation
Improvement Plan will be delayed 2-4 years and nearly half a billion dollars
worth of projects will be dropped out of the STIP.

e DISASTER RECOVERY IS IMPROVED When highways or freeways are seriously
damaged in earthquakes, problems are not just limited to the areas of damage.
An entire system used by tens of thousands of motorists is paralyzed for miles
around, obstructing firefighters, rescue workers and relief supplies. And it
undermines our state’s economy for years.

What it

e EARTHQUAKES HIT TAXPAYERS’ POCKETS Following the Loma Prieta quake,
state taxpayers were forced to pick up the tab for rebuilding. Proposition 192
will help avoid a similar shock to taxpayers.
