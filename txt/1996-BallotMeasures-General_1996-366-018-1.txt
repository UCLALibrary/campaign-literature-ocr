sewer systems have deteriorated, electrical systems are outdated. Roofs need replacing

placed. Dry rot and termite infested structures will be removed. Every school
will be brought up to current safety code compliance.

placed = Outdoor security lighting will be installed near playgrounds and
major exits. Old classroom lighting will be replaced. Additional electrical out-
lets will be installed to provide adequate electrical service in classrooms.

ground equipment will be repaired or replaced. Sidewalks and play areas will
be resurfaced. Pot holes where children play will be repaired.
