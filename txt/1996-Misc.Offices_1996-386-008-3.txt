214216

Stop the Hidden Health Care Tax

214 and 216 will hurt law enforcement
by diverting tax dollars away from
fighting crime.

Both 214 and 216 may allow convicted
criminals in state prisons to demand
additional medical procedures and

prisoners could sue if they are denied.

The state's independent Legislative

Analyst estimates that 214 and 216

could cost state and local taxpayers
hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

VOTE NO on 214 and 216.

They're bad medicine for California !

Calling 9-1-1
could save yout life.
Proposition 2-1-1
can save your
life savings.

Punish Fraud
