Ten Important Messages
to Hispanic Americans
PPB. trom the Republican Party

1. Family Values are the centerpiece of the
Republican agenda. For example, Republicans are
fighting for a $500 per child tax credit, adoption
tax credits and stricter child support enforcement.
Bill Clinton has vetoed both these family-friendly
bills.

2. Republicans passed a bill that expanded the
tax deduction on Individual Retirement Accounts
to spouses who work in the home. This bill would
have benefited Hispanic American families, but Bill
Clinton vetoed the bill.

3. Republicans are promoting incentives for small
business entrepreneurs by proposing the Tax
Incentives for Job Creation Act, H.R. 1215. Bill
Clinton vetoed this bill.

A. In 1993, Bill Clinton and the Democrat-
controlled Congress imposed the largest tax increase
in US. history. Not one Republican in the Congress
or the Senate voted for this increase. Republicans
understand that excessive taxes imposed by Bill
Clinton and the Democrats hurt hard-working
Americans.

5. Republicans are working to save key programs
such as Medicare and Medicaid, not only for today,
but for our children’s future. Republicans passed a
bill that would save Medicare and Medicaid for
future generations. The Democrats opposed it, and
Bill Clinton vetoed it.

G. Bill Clinton and the Democrats have
abandoned the war on drugs. The Clinton
Administration reduced the work force in the Office
of Drug Control Policy by 80 percent and eliminated
227 agent positions from the Drug Enforcement
Agency. Under his administration, teen drug use
has doubled. Republicans understand that simply

“not inhaling” is not an effective drug policy.
