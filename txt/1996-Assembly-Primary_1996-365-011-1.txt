STATE ASSEMBLY « #40 E-MAIL: bob@hertzberg.org

February 1, 1996

Thank you for speaking with one of my volunteers walking door to door in your
neighborhood. It was wonderful you meet and shared your concerns and ideas about our
community. My main focus is to make the government work more efficiently and to revitalize
the Valley.

I have many ideas on how to improve our quality of life in the Valley based upon my
hands-on experience as a businessman and community activist. As a member of the Valley
Industry and Commerce Association, Sherman Oaks Town Council, Taxpayers for Clean
Government and Vice Chair of the Los Angeles County Quality and Productivity Commission I
have had experience with making government work. As your Assembly member I will make
government work more efficiently through rigorous performance audits, long term strategic
planning and some common sense solutions.

My priorities in Sacramento will be to help government and business work together
effectively to retain jobs and create new opportunities for small businesses, and streamline the
permitting process. As a member of the Alliance for a Drug Free Community I am especially
committed to ridding our neighborhoods of drugs and crime related incidents. We must fight
together with the police and elected officials to restore our neighborhoods.

If | am your next Assembly member, you can be sure that the concerns of the Valley will
be-- heard and addressed-- in Sacramento. If you have any questions or concerns that you’d like
to share with me, please give me a call at my campaign office at 818-786-1996.

Kindest Regards,

HERTZBERG
