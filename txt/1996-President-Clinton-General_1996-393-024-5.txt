#2. Please talk to your family and friends about President Clinton. Your help is important to
winning on November 5th. (Continue with #5 if Senate race)

#3. As you know, our union has looked at the issues effect our jobs and our families. Based

on these issues, we have endorsed the re-election of President Clinton and Vice-President

Gore.
For example, President Clinton has fought to put middle-class and working Americans
first. He led the fight to increase the minimum wage. Under Clinton, mortgage rates,
inflation, and unemployment are the lowest in decades. He has fought to protect our
environment and occupational safety program. He has prevented huge tax breaks for
the wealthy which would have been paid for by cuts in Medicare and Medicaid for
seniors.

Also, the President has improved education by expanding the Head Start program
and making available direct low rate loans to college students. Senator Dole opposed
these and advocates making block grants of most federally funded programs.

Please consider these and other issues before voting on November 5th. (Continue
with #5 if Senate race)

#4, Thanks for your time. Goodbye.

#5. As you know, there is also an election for the U.S. Senate this November. If the election
were held today, who would you support? (Record response)

Thank you for taking the time to talk with me. Good night.
