When the local League of Women Voters sponsored
a debate, John Geranios didn't show up.

This is what be was hiding...

Geranios is anti-choice
He’s endorsed by the pro-life, arch-conservative “Traditional Values Coalition”
because he wants to limit the right to choice. (California Voter Guide, 1996)

Geranios is anti-environment

He’s taken thousands in campaign contributions from polluters, oil

companies and developers. (California Secretary of State, Form 490, 1996)

Geranios is anti-renter
As a landlord, Geranios tried to evict his tenants while they sued him for
negligence because their stairway collapsed. (Municipal Court of Los Angeles, 1991)

Geranios is anti-opportunity

He strongly favors a statewide initiative that will turn the clock back
on opportunities for qualified women in education, employment and
business contracts. (Glendale Press, 7/17/96)

Geranios is anti-schools
He would rather give a tax break to California's wealthiest 1% than increase
funding for our schools. (Glendale Press, 7/11/96)

Geranios is anti-worker
He opposes increasing California's minimum wage — the first step to
increasing all of our incomes. (Glendale Press, 7/16/96)

Vote No on John Geranios.

The closer you look, the worse he gets.
