NO ON PROPOSITION 207

QUESTIONS VOTERS SHOULD ASK ABOUT PROPOSITION 207:
THE ATTORNEYS’ FEE PROTECTION INITIATIVE

Title: ATTORNEY FEES. RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE. FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS
(qualified for the November 5, 1996, General Election ballot)

Sponsor: California trial lawyers ("Consumer Attorneys of California")

Opposition: "Coalition Against Unfair Attorneys Fees" has been formed by the Association
for California Tort Reform, and is building a broad coalition to oppose the
measure.

Background:

Proposition 207 was originally intended for the March 1996 ballot as a direct counter to
Proposition 202 limiting attorney fees. Signatures were submitted past the deadline for
the March ballot, and the measure "rolled over" to the next election where it still would
have served to negate 202 had it passed. It also would have been "matched up" against
an attorney fee restriction measure that was headed for the November ballot until its
proponent decided not to file the signatures. In this context, the initiative can be
likened to an unretrieved land mine from a prior war. But it has serious implications
for future policy-making.

In summary, the sole purpose of Proposition 207 is to prevent even the most reasonable
restraints on unreasonable attorney fees and one-sided attorney contracts. The
remaining provisions, in the words of the Legislative Analyst and Department of
Finance, "essentially maintain existing law and practice." These provisions were added
purely as a smoke screen and in an attempt to make the initiative appear attractive to

voters.

iG Attorney Fees and Contracts (Initiative Section 4)

A. The most significant part of Proposition 207 prohibits the Legislature,
retroactive to January 1, 1995, from restricting attorney fees. It locks into law
language that essentially permits lawyers to take as much as they can get from a
settlement or judgment. It does not affect fees "otherwise provided by law in
effect on January 1, 1995." Thus the measure exempts pre-existing legislation
regulating fees, such as the important consumer protection fee schedule in the
