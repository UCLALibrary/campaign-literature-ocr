Dear Friend:

Fighting crime is one of the toughest challenges our state faces, and we
are proud of the job we are doing here in Torrance.

Crime dropped 8.5% in Californian last year and in Torrance crime fell
10.8%! In fact, the FBI recently rated Torrance as one of the twenty safest
cities in the United States!

One reason we have achieved this success is due to the strong support we
receive from our local councilman, Dan Walker. Dan Walker doesn’t just talk
about fighting crime, he backs up his words by supporting front-line police
officers, ensuring that we have the latest, safest equipment and up-to-date
training procedures.

In addition, Dan Walker supports the legislative and judicial tools we need
to accomplish our mission. Specifically, he favors the death penalty,
“Three Strikes” legislation and prosecuting as adults teenage hoodlums
who commit violent crimes. He promotes tough judges and was chair of
the South Bay Committee to Defeat Rose Bird.

Because Dan Walker supports us, we are proud to give him our
whole-hearted support in his bid for State Assembly. Dan will take his
tough-on-crime record to Sacramento and fight for safer
neighborhoods throughout our district and throughout California.

On election day, November 5th, cast your vote for Dan Walker...
he has earned your vote.

Sincerely,

bfuuaul Stiih.
