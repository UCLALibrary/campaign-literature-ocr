Proposition 217 is a Retroactive Tax Increase —
Many Businesses Would Pay Penalties

Many small businesses pay their income taxes quarterly, estimating their annual taxes based upon the current rates
imposed by the state. By retroactively increasing taxes, Proposition 217 would unfairly penalize these taxpayers by
changing the rules at the end of the game. If Proposition 217 passes on November 5, all taxpayers paying quarterly at the
current 9.3% rate would not only get a tax hike, but also could be charged penalties for not paying enough throughout the
entire year!

And Where Would the New Tax Money Go?

Quite likely the money would go down a bureaucratic black hole because Proposition 217 contains absolutely no
guarantees or accountability on how the new tax money would be spent. Promoters claim it would “protect schools,” but
Proposition 217 contains no guarantees as to how much of the new money would be spent on schools. In fact, the
promoters’ own campaign materials disclose: “It is most likely that the measure will have no initial impact on schools..”

Proposition 217 is like salt on the wounds of those businesses struggling to survive in
a state that ranks 49th in the nation in the way it treats small businesses.

That's why the Small Business Committee of the California State Chamber of Commerce,
California Taxpayers’ Association, National Federation of Independent Business
and small businesses around the state oppose Proposition 217.
