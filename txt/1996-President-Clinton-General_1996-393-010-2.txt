¢ Completing nearly as many toxic waste site clean-ups under the Superfund program in each of the

Building on Our Progress

Protecting the environment will strengthen and expand our economy and create more jobs. The Clinton
Administration is implementing technology programs to help our business compete in the growing

global market while creating jobs for our workers. We will continue to support policies that protect our
health and natural resources while making common sense reforms to ease the burden on businesses by:

¢ Expanding community right-to-know laws and challenging communities to use the information
to work with business to cut pollution;

¢ Announcing a bold commitment to accelerate Superfund toxic waste cleanup, nearly doubling
the pace of cleanup so that approximately two-thirds of priority sites will be cleaned by 2000;

* — Calling for measures to expand the Brownfields initiative to cleanup and redevelop
approximately 5,000 contaminated and abandoned urban properties by 2000, strengthen
penalties for the worst criminal polluters, expand right-to-know laws about toxics in our
communities, and make our nation’s drinking water safer and cleaner; and

¢ Continuing to work with state and community leaders and businesses to find better ways to
protect our natural resources and provide economic opportunities.
