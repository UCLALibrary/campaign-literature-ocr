Explanation of Data in Table

Percent of Population in Mobilehomes

The percentage calculations are made by multiplying the number of mobilehome spaces
in parks by two and then dividing that sum by the total population in the jurisdiction.

Data on the number of mobilehome spaces in parks in each jurisdiction was obtained
from computer printouts of the California Department of Housing and Community
Development. U.S. Census data indicates that the number of mobilehome residents is
approximately double the number of mobilehomes. Population totals for each jurisdiction were
obtained from State Controller, Annual Reports 1992-93,

and Financial Transactions Counties of California.
