October 9, 1996

Dear i.

Thank you for spending the time to learn more about bringing campaign finance reform to
California. As you may or may not know, California has no laws limiting the amounts
raised and spent in election campaigns. Californians for Political Reform believes that the
time has come for immediate and effective campaign finance reform in California. We'd
like to invite you to take a serious look at Proposition 208, The California Political Reform
Act of 1996.

The California Political Reform Act of 1996 has won the support and has been endorsed by
groups and individuals across a broad political spectrum. Endorsers include: The League
of Women Voters of CA, The American Association of Retired Persons of CA, California
Common Cause, United We Stand America, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association,
National Council of Jewish Women, The American Lung Association of CA, Planning and
Conservation League, etc.

Prop. 208 will impose strict contribution limits to local and state elected officials and
candidates. Local limits are $100 per source/per election; legislative limits $250 per
source/per election; statewide limits are aed pes source/per election. Such limits would
pale in comparison to Philip Morris’ $126,000 contribution made to Steve Kuykendall in
the last week prior to his hotly contested 1994 election. These provisions will take
California's elections off the auction block and restore the voter’s voice in California
politics.

In accordance with a prior Supreme Court ruling regarding campaign spending, Prop. 208
calls for voluntary spending limits. Incentives are provided for candidates to abide by these
limits. It is estimated that had these limits been in place in 1994 spending would have been
reduced by 50%.

Another key area that Prop. 208 focuses upon is off-year fundraising. Prop. 208 would
eliminate fund-raising by incumbents in non-election years altogether. In the first half of
1995 (a non-election — alone, there were over 130 legislative fundraising events in

Sacramento. Prop. 208 would literally eliminate all the efforts made by elected officials.

We face a long campaign road ahead of us. Proposition 212, The Anti-Corruption Act
(ACA), will also be on the November '96 ballot. Prop. 212 contains serious policy flaws
and threatens, if passed, to eliminate California’s one chance at "real" campaign finance
reform-- Prop. 208. Prop. 212 repeals, without replacing, major portions of the Ethics in
Government Act, which among many other important provisions limits gifts to state elected
Officials, state legislative and local officials and candidates for elective office.
