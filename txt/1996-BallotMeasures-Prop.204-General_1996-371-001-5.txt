The Delta is a key

link in providing

water to the state’s
major industrial
sectors—from the oil
refineries and major
manufacturers in the
Bay Area and Southern
California to the Silicon
Valley's high-tech
electronics center and
the state’s numerous
food-processing facilities
in the northern,

éentral and southern

regions of the state.

7: saan to California Department of Water Resources projections, California will face
annual water shortages of between 3.7 million acre-feet (maf) and 5.7 maf during average
rainfall years, and between 7 mat and 9 maf during drought years. For perspective, 9 maf

far exceeds the current water demand for all of California's urban areas

NOTE: One acre-foot, or 326,000 gallons, is approximately the amount of water used
by an average family of five in one year.

DELTA
INTERDEPENDENCE

WATER USE AND THE DELTA

The Delta

The Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta forms at the
confluence of California's two largest rivers and
is the largest freshwater estuary in the western
United States. Providing drinking water for more
than 20 million Californians, the Delta is home to
a variety of fish and wildlife and is an integral
component of the state's $750 billion economy.

Central Valley Project

The federal Central Valley Project delivers water to
more than 3 million acres of farmland between
Redding and Bakersfield, and to cities in the Bay
Area. Water is either diverted before it reaches the
Delta, or pumped from the estuary to Central and
Southern California.

State Water Project

The State Water Project provides drinking water
for two-thirds of California's 32 million residents
and irrigation water for 1.2 million acres of farm-
land. Most of the SWP water is pumped from the
Delta and transported to Central and Southern
California via the 444-mile California Aqueduct.

Bay Area Water Projects

The San Francisco Bay Area receives much of its

water from two major water projects which divert

river water that otherwise would flow into the Delta.
The Hetch Hetchy Project, via the Hetch Hetchy
Aqueduct, serves 85% of the water use in San
Francisco and delivers water to 30 cities in the
East and South Bay.
East Bay Municipal Utility District delivers water
via the Mokelumne Aqueduct to 1.2 million
people in Alameda and Contra Costa counties.
