PROBLEM:

“SILLY LAWSUITS ARE
PUTTING PEOPLE OUT OF
BUSINESS ALL OVER.’

ILLINOIS JUST OVERHAULED
ITS LIABILITY LAWS TO HELP
SHIELD BUSINESSES FROM
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS.

Illinois knows how damaging frivolous liability lawsuits
can be. That's why new laws were recently enacted to help
businesses substantially cut the costs of protecting them-
selves. Changes in tort law, product liability and medical
malpractice all aim at protecting consumers without putting
people out of business.

It's just one more example how Illinois is pro-business. And

why your business should be pro-Illinois. ILLINOIS
