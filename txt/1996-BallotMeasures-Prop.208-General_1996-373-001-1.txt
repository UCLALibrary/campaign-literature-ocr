An incredible 80% of the campaign
contributions in California state politics comes
from outside legislators’ districts. Prop 208 sets
no limit on out-of-district money.

208 allows $1,000 contributions to state
candidates, the same amount allowed in
Congressional and Presidential elections. Since
Washington, D.C. is drowning in big money, it’s
a fraud to reinvent the same system here and call
it reform.

208 allows PACs, corporations, and rich
individuals to give $10,000 to political parties,
which can then give this money directly to
candidates. This is a huge loophole which renders
208’s already weak limits meaningless.

Direct business contributions to candidates
are banned in a majority of states and even in
federal elections. But not in California. And not in
Prop 208.

$200 million is spent annually on lobbying in
Sacramento, and corporations get a tax deduction
for their share. 208 doesn’t get rid of this special
interest tax break.

In fact, 208’s sponsors are actually seeking
support from big business, and getting it. 208 is
endorsed by Hewlett-Packard, a mega-donor in
California politics. In a written statement, 208
sponsors emphasize their hands-off treatment of
corporate donations and lobbying, while appealing
to special interests’ fear of Prop 212. They urge
“the astute CEO” to support 208 “in order to ensure
responsible reform”

Proposition 212 is real, tough reform which
will put power back in the hands of voters and get
big money out of politics. 208 is weak reform which
would give us a system no better than what we
have in federal elections now.

Vote Yes on 212. Vote No on 208.
