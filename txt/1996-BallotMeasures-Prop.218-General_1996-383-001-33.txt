Why We Need Proposition 218

Taxes, fees and assessments are out of control!

Local governments in most major cities
are imposing taxes, like utility user taxes,
without a vote of the people.

Local governments can now impose fees
and assessments on property without the
approval of those being taxed.

Since the passage of Proposition 13,
assessments on property have grown an
average of 19% a year over 15 years —a
976% increase!

Today, fees and assessments take a bigger
bite than any of the three largest taxes —
property, sales and personal income
taxes.

Fees and assessments in California
increased $1.7 billion in fiscal year 1992-
93.

According to three recent expert studies,
California governments are taking in
and spending more, even calculating for
inflation and population growth, than
they did prior to Proposition 13, a time
when governments were considered
ptichie
