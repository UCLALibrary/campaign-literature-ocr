Mayor Paul Rosenstein has worked for Santa Monica with national, state and local
leaders like President Bill Clinton, Senator Barbara Boxer, Congressman Henry
Waxman, Assembly Member Sheila Kuehl, Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros
and Heal the Bay’s Mark Gold.

Paul has worked together with these leaders to secure millions of dollars for school
funding and innovative education programs, environmental protection, the rebuilding
of Santa Monica’s breakwater and earthquake repair — including a $33 million grant
to fix multi-family dwellings damaged by the Northridge quake.

Mayor Rosenstein has
worked with local law
enforcement to create policies
that gave them the tools and
funding they needed to bring
Santa Monica’s crime rate
down by a third. Santa
Monica’s crime rate is now
lower than it has been in 20
years.

As a progressive leader with
vision, Paul Rosenstein has
worked to improve our quality
of life by protecting our
environment. One example:
Heal the Bay says our local
beaches are cleaner than ever
since Paul has been Mayor.

Mayor Rosenstein has
worked with local schools and
educators to increase school
funding and maximize joint
use of resources to improve
Santa Monica schools. Paul
has strengthened the partner-
ship between the the city and
its schools by making quality
education a top priority.
