The California Medical
Association Opposes
Proposition 215. The
Drug Legalization Lobby
Supports It.

3. THE DRUG LEGALIZATION LOBBY IS
BEHIND THIS INITIATIVE.

George Soros, a New York billionaire
who has contributed large amounts of money to
drug “decriminalization” efforts internationally is
one of three individuals who have given nearly
all of the money to qualify the Medical Use of
Marijuana Initiative for the ballot. None of these
three individuals is a doctor and none lives in
California!

Organizations such as The National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML) which back the legalization of
marijuana support this initiative.

These organizations believe the public
will be more likely to support even further
legalization of marijuana if it is first approved
for medical use.

4. THE INITIATIVE EXEMPTS
MARIJUANA FROM ALL REGULATIONS WHICH
PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM UNSAFE DRUGS.

The FDA requires extensive elie
certify medications as safe and effective before
releasing them to the public.

This initiative would make marijuana the
only controlled substance available to the public
without FDA approval. Quality and purity of the
drug would be essentially unregulated and
unmonitored.

In addition, this initiative would make
marijuana available without a prescription,
therefore bypassing all established medical
guidelines tor dispensing drugs.

THC, the active ingredient in
marijuana, is already available on the market
as the FDA approved drug Marinol.

Responsible physicians wishing to treat
AIDS patients, cancer Lp and other truly ill
people can prescribe this drug right now.

We cannot allow anyone to prey upon
the sick and dying under the guise of “compas-
sion” to circumvent the FDA, and thus open the
door to outright legalization.

With a nationwide push against
tobacco smoking, there is no way that smokin
marijuana, an illegal intoxicating drug, pia
be portrayed as “Beneficial.”

5. PROPOSITION 215 SENDS THE
WRONG MESSAGE TO YOUNG PEOPLE.

Marijuana use is on the increase among
young people and drug abuse is a serious social
problem.

California taxpayers spend millions of
dollars attempting to educate our children to “say
no to drugs” — and hundreds of millions more
dealing with the problems caused by drug

abusers.

This initiative sends the message to our
children that marijuana is a safe, effective
medical treatment rather than a dangerous,
illegal drug. This is the wrong message.
