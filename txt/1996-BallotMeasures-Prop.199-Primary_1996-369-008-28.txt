Change is in the air. You don’t need to be a political expert to know that voters want
changes in the way they are governed. At the local level voters want:

* Better basic services ¢ Improved public safety
* More effective use of tax dollars ¢ More responsive government

Examples of this shift are national in scope. Besides realignments in California in
1994, voters in traditionally liberal Massachusetts approved a measure to repeal rent
control statewide. The message was clear; voters want resources to focus on the
truly needy and the broader public — not just special interests.

Local governments need new ways to safeguard their constituencies without
increasing regulatory controls, or spending limited taxpayer dollars in the process.
The Mobilehome Fairness Initiative offers just such an opportunity.

The Mobilehome Fairness Initiative continues the trend in California toward less
government and lower taxes, while retaining local oversight of the public good and
promoting changes important to voters.

Here’s what the initiative does:

Phases out current rent control ordinances so that nobody with existing rent
protections will be affected, but new residents will pay a market rate rent.
Average mobilehome tenant turnover period is 10 years. A decade will pass before
this law is fully implemented.

Offers park residents a privately funded subsidy

The Initiative offers a 10% rent subsidy to 10% of residents in non-rent controlled
parks — 60% of the state’s park residents, equal to 300,000 people will be
immediately eligible if they qualify. Qualification is based on Section 50105 of the
California Health and Safety Code criteria. Parkowners, not taxpayers, pay for the
subsidy.
