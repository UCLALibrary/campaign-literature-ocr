PROHIBITION ON RATE INCREASES
KEEPS HMO INDUSTRY HONEST

A Excessive profits and HMO bureaucracy are slowly
strangling patient care.

> According to the California Medical Association, as much
as 30 cents of every premium dollar paid to an HMO goes to
administrative costs and the bloated salaries of CEOs, while
the quality of patient care continues to decline. (Knox-Keene
Health Plan Expenditures Summary, CMA, Feb. 1996) The
Patient Protection Act ensures that health care dollars be
applied to medicine rather than bureaucracy, and that any
new rate increases go toward medical care, not more admin-
istration or excessive CEO salaries.

A Industry reps use scare tactics about increased rates to
hold pro-consumer reforms hostage.

> The Patient Protection Act opponents claim that the basic

ground rules for higher quality patient care will increase med-

ical costs. (L.A. Times, April 23, 1996).The Act’s prohibition

on unnecessary rate increases ensures that any rate increase

be justified under penalty of perjury and that insurers cannot
pass the cost of higher quality care onto consumers while keep-
ing 30 cents of every premium dollar for profit and overhead.

Rate increases should not finance excessive industry profits.

> Not-for-profit hospitals sit on cash assets of some $200 bil-
lion. In 1994, the six largest HMOs in California raked in
profits of more than $1.3 billion and accumulated combined .
cash reserves of $5.6 billion, while the salaries of the CEOs of
the five largest HMOs in California ranged from $843,803 to
$3,225,000 [Health care has been the #1 for-profit industry in
America this decade.] (Modern Healthcare, Oct. 23, 1995; L.A.
Times, Aug. 20, 1995)

> Hospital and nursing home chain profits rose 26% in
1995 over 1994. Columbia/HCA alone, the nation’s largest
provider, recorded $1.9 billion in profit. Kaiser Permanente
reported $550.2 million in net income. [For a four-year total
of nearly $3 billion.] (Jay Greene and Sandy Lutz, “A Tale of
