The Origin of
The Elephant Symbol

This symbol of the party was born in the imagination of cartoonist Thomas Nast and first presented in Harper's Weekly on
Nov. 7, 1874.

James Gordon Bennett's New York Herald raised the cry of “Caesarism” in connection with the Possibility of a third-term try
for President Ulysses S. Grant. The issue was taken up by Democratic politicians in 1874, halfway through Grant's second
term and just before the midterm elections, and helped disatfect Republican voters. While the illustrated journals were
depicting Grant wearing a crown, the Herald involved itself in another Circulation-builder in an entirely different, nonpolitical
area. This was the Central Park Menagerie Scare of 1874, a delightful hoax perpetrated by the Herald. They ran a story,
totally untrue, that the animals in the zoo had broken loose and were roaming the wilds of New York's Central Park in search
of prey.

and the elephant soon ceased to be the vote and became the Party itself; the jackass, now referred to as a donkey, made
a natural transition from representing the Herald to representing the Democratic party that had frightened the elephant.
