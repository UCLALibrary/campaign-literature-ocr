Adam and Eve 2

Dear Friend,

Before the votes are counted, Eve and | wanted to thank the literally
thousands of you we met who offered their advice, opinions,
hospitality and support. Your kindness more than made up for the
rigors of this long campaign.

While | was disappointed that my opponent chose not to join me ina
serious discussion of the issues, | am proud of my campaign. | tried

to offer thoughtful proposals to reform our juvenile justice system and
improve our schools.

| would be honored to have your vote on Tuesday. | cannot promise
we will always agree, but | do promise that | will work hard, listen, and
always vote the way my conscience tells me is in the best interests of
the people | represent.

| look forward to serving you as your State Senator.

Aan Seut
