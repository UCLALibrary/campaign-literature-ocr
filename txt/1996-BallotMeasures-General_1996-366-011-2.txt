Dear Parent:

On November 5 you will be asked to vote on the first Los Angeles Unified School District
bond placed on the ballot since 1974. If the bond passes, these funds will be used to
respond to major repair needs in your child’s school.

As the parent of a public school student, you are aware that major repairs in paving, interior
painting, floor covering and classroom lighting have not been made for some time. Since
1988, only essential repairs have been completed in the District due to reduced funding.

At the current level of deferred maintenance funding, it would take 50 years to complete
these major a without this bond issue, and that is only if no new projects are added to
the backlog. The infrastructure of our schools is critical, and state and federal funding have
been and will continue to be inadequate to meet the needs of our students.

In the weeks to come, you will be hearing a lot about Proposition BB. I ask that you take
the time between now and November 5 to gather the information you need to make the best
choice for our children. Impartial information is available through the Bond Information
Office at (213) 633-3740. ‘

A list of specific repairs for our school is available in our main office for your review.

The bond issue will affect you as a parent and as a citizen, whether it passes or fails.
’ Please exercise your informed choice at the polls on November 5.

Sincerely,

x.

Faculty Representative
