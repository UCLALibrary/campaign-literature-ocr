to eradicate all mobilehome rent control by:

(1) Appearing to offer a rent subsidy that, in actuality, virtually no one shall
receive, and which only decreases rent by 10% froma rent which the park owner has previously
chosen; and asp

(2) Convincing voters that local mobilehome rent control is somehow unfair
to private business and costs the taxpayers money, while the illusory subsidy can Produce better

’ results.
