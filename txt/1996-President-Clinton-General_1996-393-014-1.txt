What President Clinton’s Accomplishments Have Achieved for the People of California:

$15,000 OF REDUCED FEDERAL DEBT FOR EVERY FAMILY OF FOUR IN CALIFORNIA:
The national debt will be more than $1 trillion lower over-seven-years than was projected before the
passage of the President’s economic plan. That’s about $15,000 of reduced rhea debt for each family of

10 TIMES MORE CALIFORNIA FAMILIES RECEIVE A TAX CUT THAN A TAX INCREASE:
As a result of the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit, 2,146,915 working families in California will
receive a tax cut. This compares to an increase in the income tax rate for only the 218,777 wealthiest
taxpayers in California.

TAX CUT FOR 178,917 SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA: The President helped
entrepreneurs, proprietors, and other small businessmen and women by expanding the annual expensing
allowance from $10,000 to $17,500. About 178,917 small businesses in California are likely to benefit from
the expansion of the expensing allowance this year alone and many more will benefit over the coming
years.

4,959,000 CALIFORNIA WORKERS PROTECTED BY FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT:
The Family and Medical Leave Act allows workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth of
a child, to care for a sick family member, or if they become too sick to work. This law covers about
4,959,089 workers in California, and protects the jobs of 297,914 workers in California who are likely to
use unpaid leave this year alone.

1.65 MILLION STUDENTS AND FORMER STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO
BENEFIT FROM STUDENT LOAN REFORMS: Approximately 1.65 million California borrowers -
1.16 million current borrowers and 490,000 new borrowers in the next few years - can take advantage of
the new direct student loan program by participating directly in the program or by consolidating
guaranteed loans into direct loans. Some will benefit from lower interest rates, and all will benefit from
more repayment options, including income contingent repayment. P/CABETTER.% 5/17/96
