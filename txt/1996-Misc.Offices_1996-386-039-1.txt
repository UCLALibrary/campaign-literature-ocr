joo e CARAL PAST

The pro-choice majority in the State Legislature is in jeopardy. Because of term limits, 1996 is a crit-

ical year for pro-choice voters.

Tue STATE ASSEMBLY ~ Twenty-six seats are open this year. Eighteen pro-choice members are either running for higher office or retiring.
The new Speaker of the Assembly is anti-choice and has listed as one of his top priorities, severe restrictions on a woman’s right to
choose in California.

THE STATE SENATE ~ Pro-choice leadership could be decided by a mere two races. Ten seats are open this year. Seven pro-choice mem-
bers cannot run for re-election.

The federal debate on criminalizing doctors for delivering necessary medical care for their patients has moved to California. Anti-choice
State Senator Ray Haynes introduced a bill that would ban medical procedures for late-term abortions, even when the woman’s life and
health are at risk. That bill failsed on the Assembly floor by only one vote!

CARALS electoral focus is to identify, educate and mobilize pro-choice voters to return the Assembly to pro-choice leadership and to
protect the State Senate from an anti-choice take-over.

The 1996 California Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League Political Action Committee Voter’s Guide is the culmination of
hundreds of hours of research and work. Candidates running for office are asked to complete questionnaires covering the issues of legal-
ity, funding, minors’ access and, in 1996, banning medical procedures. Additionally, we use the voting records of sitting legislators.
Many candidates, especially those with mixed or anti-choice positions, are reluctant to state their positions on this important issue.
They do not wish the voters to fully understand how extreme they are on curtailing women’s reproductive freedom. When a candidate
fails to respond to the CARAL-PAC questionnaire, we utilize voting records, public statements and letters to constituents — whatever
factual information exists — to provide voters with the most comprehensive pro-choice Voter’s Guide in California.

The minimum standards for candidate endorsement by the CARAL-PAC are a commitment to keeping abortion safe and legal, as well
as support for public funding of abortion for women who rely on government funding for their health care coverage.

CARAL-PAC has a policy of endorsing sitting legislators with a history of voting pro-choice who are running for re-election to their
same seats. Where those sitting legislators are running for higher office, CARAL gave weight to their long legislative history on the issue
of a woman’s fundamental rights. If it appears that all candidates are pro-choice based on the questionnaires, CARAL-PAC traditionally
remains neutral. However, an endorsement may be given if one candidate has an extensive leadership record on the issue or if several
anti-choice candidates are in the race and the CARAL-PAC believes an endorsement is necessary in order to defeat the anti-choice candi-
date. : yee
