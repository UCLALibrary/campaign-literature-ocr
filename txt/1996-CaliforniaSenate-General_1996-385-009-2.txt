For Our Future

A Commitment to Education

Assemblywoman Paula Boland believes our
children deserve the very best we have to offer.
That's why she’s leading the fight at the State
Capitol to revitalize our schools and put more
resources into our classrooms.

“You deserve a round of applause.
We graciously value your on-going
efforts to preserve the availability of

affordable quality education in
California.”
Catherine Hazelton

Paula believes a quality education means
reducing class sizes, placing greater emphasis
on academic fundamentals and providing a safe
environment for our children to learn and
achieve their potential.

When gang members threatened students at
local schools, Paula Boland went into action -
and passed a tough new “Safe Schools” law to

A Record of Achievement

As a leading member of the Assembly Education
Committee, Paula Boland successfully fought to
reduce class sizes, so that our children will get
the individual instruction they need.

Fed up with mismanagement and waste,

she passed a law to break up the mammoth
Los Angeles Unified School District, and gave
teachers and parents - not bureaucrats - more
control over decisions affecting our

local schools.

Assemblywoman Paula Boland. She’s written
some of the most important laws to help our
children. As our State Senator, she’ll do

even more.
