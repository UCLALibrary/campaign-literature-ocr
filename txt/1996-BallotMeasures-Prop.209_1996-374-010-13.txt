underlying reasoning of the Romer decision by the

Seattle decisions. Therefore, a U.S. Supreme Court
interpretation rejecting the Colorado decision would
probably affect how the U.S. Supreme Court would view

the public entity’s own prior or future discrimination in
violation of federal law, all the scholars agreed that
prohibiting such a plan would be unconstitutional. When
an affirmative action plan was instituted by consent
decree as a remedy for past discrimination in violation of
federal law, all the scholars agree a prohibition probably
would be unconstitutional. Since Section 31 (e) would
exempt court orders or consent decrees that are in force as
of the effective date of this section, the scholars’ analyses
apply to future orders or consent decrees in state courts.
(As a state constitutional amendment, the initiative could
have no impact on federal courts.)

Regarding affirmative action plans instituted by

discrimination, the scholars are split on the question of
constitutionality.

Professors Chemerinsky, Grodin and Landsberg all
concluded that the CCRI could not preclude voluntary
affirmative action plans undertaken by public entities to
remedy evidence of past discrimination in accord with
federal constitutional principles. Professor Varat thought
the U.S. Supreme Court would uphold the
