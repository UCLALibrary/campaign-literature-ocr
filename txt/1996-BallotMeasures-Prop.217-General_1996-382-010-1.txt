PROPOSITION 217

Title: Top Income Tax Brackets. Reinstatement. Revenues to Local Agencies.
Initiative Statute.

Provisions:

This statutory initiative would permanently raise taxes by retroactively reimposing 10
percent and 11 percent tax brackets that were temporarily in effect from January 1,
1991 through December 31, 1995. Revenue generated from this tax increase would be
allocated to schools according to Proposition 98 formulas and the remainder would
replace a portion of property tax revenue shifted by the Legislature in 1992 and 1993
from cities, counties and special districts to schools. Specifically, Proposition 217
would:

* Retroactively impose a 10 percent personal income tax rate for California taxpayers
with taxable income over $115,000, and an 11 percent rate for taxable income over
$230,000, effective January 1, 1996. (Joint filers would pay at incomes over
$230,00 and $460,000, respectively.)

+ Allocate approximately half of the increased revenue to schools through the
Proposition 98 guarantee; the remainder would be allocated to local governments
based on their proportionate share of property tax revenue being transferred to local
schools and community colleges since 1992 and 1993 law changes. There are no
requirements as to how the money would actually be spent.

* Prohibit any reduction in a local agency's proportionate share of property tax,
without respect to future growth patterns. It would prevent growing communities
from receiving their full share of future property tax revenues.

* Lock in place the dollar amount and proportion of income tax paid by taxpayers in

the new 10 percent and 11 percent brackets as the minimum with regard to future
changes in the state personal income tax.
