THE CHALLENGES
Excerpts from President Clinton’s 1996 State of
the Union Address

“Our First challenge is to cherish our children
and strengthen America’s families. Family is
the foundation of American life. If we have
stronger families, we will have a stronger
America. . . . 1 challenge America’s families to
work harder to stay together. For families who
stay together not only do better economically,
their children do better as well.”

“Our second challenge is to provide Americans
with the educational opportunities we will all
need for this new century. . . I challenge our
parents to become their children’s first teachers.
Turn off the TV. See that the homework is
done. and visit your children’s classroom. No-
program, no teacher, no one else can do that for
you.”

“Our third challenge is to help every American
who is willing to work for it, achieve economic
security in this new age. So I challenge
Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping,
antiquated job-training programs into a simple
voucher worth $2,600 for unemployed or
underemployed workers to use as they please
for community college tuition or other training.
This is a G.I. Bill for America’s workers we
should all be able to agree on.”

“Our fourth great challenge is to take our streets
back from crime and gangs and drugs. . . . Our
next step in the fight against crime is to take on
gangs the way we once took on the mob. . . to
reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the
drug problem. The challenge begins in our
homes, with parents talking to their children
openly and firmly. It embraces our churches
and synagogues, our youth groups and our
schools.”

“Our fifth challenge: to leave our environment
safe and clean for the next generation. Because
of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have
cleaner water and air, lead levels in children’s
blood has been cut by 70 percent, toxic

emissions from factories cut in half. Lake Erie
was dead, and now it’s a thriving resource. But
10 million children under 12 still live within
four miles of a toxic waste dump. A third of us
breathe air that endangers our health. And in too
many communities, the water is not safe to
drink. We still have much too do.”

“Our sixth challenge is to maintain America’s
leadership in the fight for freedom and peace
throughout the world. . . . The threats we face
today as Americans respect no nation’s borders.
Think of them: terrorism, the'spread of weapons
of mass destruction, organized crime, drug
trafficking, ethnic and religious hatred,
aggression by rouge states, environmental
degradation. If we fail to address these threats
today, we will suffer the consequences in all of
our tomorrow’s . . . But as the Cold War fades
into memory, voices of isolation say America
should retreat from its responsibilities. I say

they are wrong.”

“My fellow Americans, the six challenges I
have just discussed are for all of us. Our
seventh challenge is really America’s challenge
to those of us in this hallowed hall tonight: to
reinvent government and make our democracy
work forthem. . .. America has always sought
and risen to every challenge. Who would say
that, having come so far together, we will not go
forward from here? Who will say that this age
of possibility is not for all Americans? Our
country has always been a great and good
nation. But the best is yet to come, if we all do
our part.”

The President Connects
Students With The Future

On March 9, 1996, President Clinton came
to the Bay area and helped implement a plan he
proposed in his State of the Union Address:
starting the process of connecting every school
in the nation to the Internet by the turn of the
century. (see page 5)
