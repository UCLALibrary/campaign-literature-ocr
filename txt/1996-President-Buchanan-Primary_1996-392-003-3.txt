across our borders every year, it’s time to call a halt.

It’s not just in escalating crime that we’re forced to pay

We also pay in health care.

ABC News told this story of an EL Paso couple: The husband

illegal immigrants received $3 million each year in free care.

cover health-care costs for illegal aliens who refuse to pay
their own bills.

When everything is accounted for, including government
handouts and lost jobs for American citizens, illegal-aliens-cost
taxpayers a whopping $13.1 billion in 1993.

unity.

For decades now our institutions of assimilation have been
battered by liberals ashamed of America’s heritage and by
multiculturalists who despise it.

squabbling nationalities. . .each preserving its separate
nationality.”
