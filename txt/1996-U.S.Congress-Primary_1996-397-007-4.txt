BRAD SHERMAN

A fighter for tax justice on the Board of Equalization.

In 1990, Brad Sherman decided to become a more
forceful advocate for tax reform. He ran for the State
Board of Equalization, California’s elected tax
commission, and won an upset victory over a long-time
status quo politician.

As a member of the Board of Equalization, Brad works
to make the tax laws fairer for middle class families
and small businesses.

Brad stopped foreign-owned multi-nationals from a $2
billion raid on California taxpayers. He re-wrote state
tax codes to encourage high-salary manufacturing and
studio jobs. He prevented Governor Pete Wilson from
canceling the 1992 renters’ tax credit and worked to
plug special interest tax loopholes. He eliminated the
requirement that new small businesses post a $10,000
tax deposit, and helped many struggling entrepreneurs
get off the ground.

Brad Sherman may be best known for successfully
leading the fight to overturn Pete Wilson’s unfair
“Snack Tax.” “If they’re going to start taxing food,”
Sherman said, “let them start with caviar.”

Now, Brad Sherman is running for Congress. He will
bring extraordinary professional qualifications and
unquestioned integrity to the House of
Representatives. That’s why Democrats across the
24th District have united for Brad Sherman.

“Wealthy special interests hire a raft of lobbyists and
lawyers to riddle the tax laws with loopholes to benefit
them. But no one defends the interests of hard working

families.”
