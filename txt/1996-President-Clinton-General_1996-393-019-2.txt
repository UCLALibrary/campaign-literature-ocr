THE FACTS: USA Today set the record straight on August 7, 1996: "The Bureau of Labor
Statistics’ consumer expenditure survey says that in 1994, the latest year for which figures are
available, the average household -- not necessarily a two-income household -- spends $16,336 on
food, clothing and housing vs. $5,897 on taxes, including property tax, Social Security payroll
tax, and federal, state, and local income tax."

ATTACK: “We have got stagnant wages.”

THE FACTS: This is wrong. After falling by 79 cents during the Reagan-Bush years, wages
are now rising. [Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 10/4/96] As Business Week
wrote: “Real wages are rising for the first time in a decade.” [3/11/96] According to the Census
Bureau, real median household income increased more in 1995 than in any year in a decade, and
the typical family’s income, adjusted for inflation, has increased by $1,631 since 1993. [Census
Bureau, 9/26/96] Since President Clinton took office, every family income group -- from the
poorest to the most well-off -- has seen their income increase. [Census Bureau, 9/26/96]

CLAIM: “My mother would tell me: Bob...Don’t cut [Medicare]. I wouldn’t violate anything
my mother said.”

THE FACTS: He reaffirmed his vote against Medicare just last year. “I was there, fighting the
fight, voting against Medicare — one of 12 -- because we knew it wouldn’t work in 1965.” [Bob
Dole Speech to the American Conservative Union 10/24/95]. The record shows that Senator
Dole continues to try and cut Medicare. In 1995, Dole-Gingrich tried to cut Medicare by $270
billion, doubling premiums. Now 83% of economists surveyed by The Economist said Dole
would have to cut Medicare to balance the budget and enact his risky and unaffordable tax
scheme. [Economist, October 5, 1996] Dole’s own Campaign Co-Chairman, Senator Al

D’ Amato, was more candid than the candidate: ““You’re gonna have to look at Medicare...I mean,
I’m not running this year, so I can say it and tell the truth.” [Don Imus Show, 8/12/96]

ATTACK: “The President wants to increase spending 20% in the next six years.”

THE FACTS: The President’s balanced budget -—- including his new initiatives -- would cut
spending by more than $500 billion to its lowest level in over 3 decades as a share of the
economy [CBO, May 1996, and OMB, FY97 Budget Historical Tables, Table 1.2]. Under
President Clinton, spending has declined each year as a share of the economy and is now lower
than any year under Presidents Reagan or Bush. [OMB, FY97 Budget Historical Tables, Table
1.2] :

THE CLAIM: “[Under the Dole tax scheme] I want the government to pinch pennies...6
percentage points over six years.”
