Proposition 197
Amendment of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1990
Mountain Lions

This much needed amendment to the Wildlife Protection Act of 1990 will bring
public safety and sound science back to the wildlife management practices of the state by
allowing the state’s largest predator to be managed in conjunction with all other species,
including those upon which it preys

Specifically, this measure will:

e Require the State Department of Fish and Game to study the mountain lion species to
better understand its needs and habits. °

¢ Require the Department to then prepareand propose to the State Fish and Game
Commission a management plan for the lions that provides for the protection and
sustainability of mountain lions and other species as well as the necessary public safety
protections that are not currently being provided for under Proposition 117. There are
no specific management tools specified by this act.

e Require that the management plan adopted by:the Fish and Game Commission through
the public hearing process be carried out by the Department.

e Reallocate to the Department of Fish and Game from the Habitat Conservation fund
$250,000 annually for the first three years to complete the study of the mountain lions,
and then up to $100,000 annually thereafter for the implementation of the mountain
lion management plan.

e Return the legislative vote requirements relating to mountain lion policy to a simple
majority from the current four-fifths vote to make it consistent with other state policy
vote requirements.

‘© Declares the Legislature’s intent that up to $250,000 be appropriated annually for
public safety and public information programs related to mountain lions.
