Two Democrats are seeking your vote for State Assembly.
Bob Hertzberg and Francine Oschin.

Hertzberg is a trial lawyer with a checkered background. He likes to sue
people. Hertzberg doesn’t only sue people for his clients... he sues them for
himself.

Hertzberg even sued his father!

And, it this weren't bad enough... according to official records on file with the
Court, he sued his father while his father was in the hospital with a serious
illness. His father died soon afterward.

Hertzberg then subpoenaed his stepmother into a deposition in which it was
reported that she left in tears because of Hertzberg’s brutal treatment of her.

Now, Hertzberg wants your vote for the State Assembly. He wants to bring
the same tactics he has always used — lawsuits and intimidation, to the State
Assembly.

Is that what we need to clean things up in Sacramento? Another trial lawyer?
Another shark?

Fortunately, Democrats have a choice. We can vote for Francine Oschin.

Council member, and a Valley resident since 1961.
