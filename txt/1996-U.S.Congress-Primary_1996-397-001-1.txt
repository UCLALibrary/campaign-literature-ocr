Dear

Brad Sherman is the only candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives
endorsed by the Democratic Party, Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer,
and our retiring Congressman Tony Beilenson.

The Peace Officers Research Association of California, representing 39,000
police officers, endorse Brad Sherman because he is committed to making our
streets safe again.

Brad Sherman will work to stop the Republican Congress from gutting clean air
and water standards and from selling off the Santa Monica Mountains to
developers -- that's why the California League of Conservation Voters endorses
Brad Sherman.

Congressman Tony Beilenson calls Brad Sherman "a man of integrity and
independence." That's the kind of representation we deserve -- vote on Tuesday,
March 26, for Brad Sherman for the U.S. House of Representatives.

Brad Sherman is endorsed by:

California Democratic Party Senator Barbara Boxer

Senator Dianne Feinstein California Teachers Association

Peace Officers Research Association Congressman Tony Beilenson
League of Conservation Voters

DEMOCRAT Sor CONGRESS

Paid for and authorized by Sherman for Congress. 14008 Ventura Blvd. Sherman Oaks, CA 91403
