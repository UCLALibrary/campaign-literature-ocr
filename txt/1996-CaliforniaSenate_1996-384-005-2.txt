Betty Karnette Voted For It.

Karnette voted for
Willie Brown’s bill
letting politicians
off the hook.

In the Assembly, Betty Karnette voted to
weaken the law against political corruption—
reducing conflict of interest penalties from a
felony to a simple misdemeanor, so convicted
lawbreakers could stay in office.

The bill was authored by then Speaker Willie
Brown, and Betty Karnette voted for it on
September 10, 1993.

Her vote would have created a double
standard—one for us, one for politicians. And
that’s wrong.

Betty Karnette’s liberal views are so extreme
she even refused to ban the sale of hard core
pornography in vending machines accessible to
children. (Assembly Bill 612, May 1993)

She also refused to limit conjugal visits for
murderers and sex offenders. (assembly bill 546, June 1993)

And Betty Karnette wants to weaken
California’s tough “Three Strikes” law—which
has helped cut crime by 23% since voters
approved it two years ago.

Phil Hawkins believes public officials should
lead by example and be judged by a higher
standard.

In the Assembly, he refused two legislative
pay raises—a 37% raise in 1994 and another
5% raise in 1995.

He voted to make the governor and lawmakers
forfeit their salaries for every day the state
budget is late.

He helped deliver an extra $21 million for
more police in Los Angeles County.

Phil Hawkins is defending California’s tough
“Three Strikes” law against liberal politicians
like Betty Karnette.

He voted to expand the death penalty to
include murder committed during a drive-by
shooting or carjacking.

And he wrote the “Gun Free Schools Act” to
help protect children from gun violence.

Phil Hawkins is setting a higher standard of
leadership—not trying to lower it.
