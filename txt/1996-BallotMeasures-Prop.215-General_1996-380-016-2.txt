Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti and San Francisco Sheriff Mike Hennessey.

Throughout AB 1529’s travels, the Legislature acted with compassion and
courage, passing the bill with support from prominent Democrats and Republicans.
But once again we were thwarted by Pete Wilson’s veto.

As a result, concerned Californians decided to take the same approach as AB
1529 and make it into a ballot initiative — Proposition 215. Just like our bill, Prop. 215
creates a legal defense for patients who are using marijuana now with their doctor’s
approval. If they’re caught with marijuana, they'll know not to worry about going to
jail and losing everything. Moreover, voters can tell these seriously and terminally ill
people that they don’t have to feel like criminals for relieving their pain with
marijuana.

Prop. 215 allows the people of California to make the compassionate decision
that Governor Wilson refused to make. It’s your life, it’s your freedom, and your
support for this initiative may well improve the quality of life for someone you love.
