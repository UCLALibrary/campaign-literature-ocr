Dear

Thank you for taking the time to speak with one of my campaign volunteers last week.
| really appreciate your consideration and support of my campaign for Congress.

The response | have received from all of my neighbors of the 24th district has been
overwhelming. Most of my new supporters have said that | have been the only
candidate to offer--in writing-- specific ideas to fight crime, create jobs, rebuild our
education system and reform healthcare.

| have enclosed some additional information that | hope will convince you to stand with
the California Council of Senior Citizens and the National Council On Public
Safety--COPS-—in supporting me for Congress.

| haven’t been running for one political office after another and | haven’t accepted
money from lobbyists or powerful special interest groups in Washington so you can be
confident in the fact that | am going to Congress to serve you and the people of the
24th district where | was born and raised and am now raising my family.

As a businessman, | also know we need to nurture small businesses in our district by
providing more access to capital, tax incentives to create jobs, and cut bureaucratic
red tape.

| hope | can count on your vote Tuesday, March 26th. Remember, your vote is your
voice and an opportunity to shape the future of our country.

Again, thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

.

yee

Jeff Lipow
