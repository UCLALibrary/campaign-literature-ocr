neighborhoods
should be

safer than a
war zone.

Kids on the streets of our
community have enough firepower
to fight a war.

other, innocent bystanders become

the victims. Children die... parents
die... and we lose the freedom to
move around our neighborhoods in

safety.

this when I was growing up here.
