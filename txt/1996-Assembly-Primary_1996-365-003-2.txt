It's difficult making sense out of all the campaign mailers. What
do you look for in a public representative? It's trust. Your vote
is a symbol of your trust. Compare the leading candidates.

Which one
do you trust?

Someone who
is qualified...

Someone who
has experience...

Someone who we
can trust with our
tax dollars...

Someone who is
independent, who we
can trust to represent
our interests...

Someone who you can
trust to put your
family's safety first...
