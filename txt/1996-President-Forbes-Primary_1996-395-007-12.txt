Punishes the moral values at the heart of a free
society and rewards the values that undermine a free
society.

I want to be president so we can get government out
of the way and open the doors to this New American
Awakening -- a time when the epidemic of divorce and
single-parent families begins to recede and families return
to the center of national life... a time of worshipful prayer
for the great blessings bestowed upon our land... a time
when entrepreneurial energy and creative drive bum
brighter than ever before in our history... a time when
respect for community and faith and a confidence in our
national goodness and purpose reawaken in our halls of
government... a time when our schools once more respect
the values of parents and communities... a time when our
political leaders come from the people and are no longer
seen as a separate class unto themselves... a time of rebirth
for government of the people, by the people and for the
people.

Other candidates have talked about a conservatism of
the heart. I believe that our heart must be as big as
America... as big as Our promise... as big as-our hopes...
as big as the values that have sustained us in the cause of
freedom for the past 200 years. Our movement must have
a heart that is as big as the soul and spirit of America...
and that is boundless, courageous and never shirking.
