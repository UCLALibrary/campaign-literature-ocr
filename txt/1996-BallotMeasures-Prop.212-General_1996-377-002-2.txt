ep Crack down on lobbyists.

A tax loophole allows special interests to deduct
their lobbying expenses from the income taxes
they pay. Prop. 212 eliminates this special tax
break and also bans gifts from lobbyists to
legislators.

4) Limit campaign spending.

Spending on political campaigns in California
has increased by 4,000% since 1958. Prop. 212
sets low, mandatory spending limits, and ends
candidates' dependence on big money and
special interests.

Prop. 212 will take government out of the hands
of special interests and put it back in the hands _.
of ordinary citizens. But if a weak alternative
on the Nov. Sth ballot -- Prop. 208 -- gets more
votes, it will completely nullify Prop. 212.

Vote No on 208. Vote Yes on 212.
