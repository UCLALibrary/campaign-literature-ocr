» California has the
lowest minimum wage on
the West Coast, but one
of the highest costs of
living in the nation.
Oregon and Washington
have higher minimum
wages, yet they boast
lower unemployment
rates than California.

» Between 1979 and
1994, productivity
increased 20%, but
workers’ wages went
down 9% after adjusting
for inflation. A full time
minimum wage worker
would have to work more
than 19 months in order
to earn as much as an
average CEO makes in
one day!

2» According to the
California Department of
Social Services, a $5.75
minimum wage would
mean smaller welfare
payments to tens of
thousands of working
poor. Taxpayers would
save $21 million in
welfare costs.

Proposition 210: What your vote

Proposition 210 will increase the state minimum
wage over two years to $5.75 in 1998. The
purpose of Proposition 210 is to restore the

purchasing power of the =
minimum wage, which is

at a 40-year low, so that

hard work no longer is
rewarded with poverty.

The federal increase

passed by the Gingrich
Congress falls far short of
that goal. It still leaves a
minimum wage family of three

poverty line, and does not

California’s higher

make a living. They have
opposed an increase in the state
minimum wage. They have
written bills to abolish the right
to overtime pay, slash wages for
construction workers and allow
restaurant employers to credit
tips against the minimum wage.
They argue that increasing the
minimum wage would reduce
the number of jobs and welfare
costs. Yet independent studies
show that when California last
increased the minimum wage in
1988, it spurred the creation of
thousands of new jobs.

Proposition 214: What your vote will do

A vote for Proposition 214 will protect patient rights by preventing HMOs
and insurance companies from turning health care into a business that
cares more about making money than healing patients. It says HMOs
can't refuse your doctor's recommended care without a second opinion. It
bans written and unwritten gag rules on health care workers. Under Prop.
214, HMOs and insurance companies will no longer be able to pay doctors
bonuses or incentives to delay or withhold needed care. They also must
