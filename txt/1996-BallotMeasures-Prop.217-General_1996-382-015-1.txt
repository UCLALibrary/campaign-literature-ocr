the $700 Million Dollar Tax Increase!

NO ON PROPOSITION 217

¥ Raises taxes. V Hurts small business.
¥ Money down a bureaucratic black hole.

TAXES IN CALIFORNIA
' ARE ALREADY TOO HIGH!

But that doesn’t concern the
promoters of this measure. If Proposition .
217 passes, California would effectively

Vv.

the country.

ARETROACTIVE TAX INCREASE

Proposition 217 imposes a retroactive and
PERMANENT TAX INCREASE on income
earned since January 1, 1996.

HURTS SMALL BUSINESS

Its promoters may have intended to soak
the rich, but Proposition 217 would hurt the
state’s small business owners. Eighty (80)
percent of California’s businesses pay
personal, NOT corporate income taxes.

HIGHER TAXES FOR SMALL
BUSINESS MEAN LESS MONEY
FOR JOBS AND SALARIES

Small businesses are the engines driving
California’s economic recovery. In fact,
small companies are creating 60% of all our
new jobs. It just doesn’t make sense to
saddle these job-creators with higher taxes.

Proposition 217 makes California the
NUMBER ONE TAX STATE while at the
same time the state ranks 49th in the way we
treat small business. If Proposition 217
passes, some companies may decide enough
is enough and move their businesses and the
jobs they provide OUT of California to
states with lower income tax rates.

WHERE WILL THE
NEW TAK MONEY GO?

Mostlikely the money will go down a
bureaucratic black hole because Proposition
217 contains absolutely no guarantees or
accountability on how the new tax money
will be spent.

Promoters claim it “protects schools,” but
Proposition 217 contains no guarantees how
much of this new tax money would be spent
on schools. In fact, the promoters own
campaign materials disclose: “It is most
likely that the measure will have no initial
impact on schools...”

Neither do they account for just how that
money would be spent. Your tax money
could end up paying for bureaucrats and
administrators, not on the kids and in the
classroom.
