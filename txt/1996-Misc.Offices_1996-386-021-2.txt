That's why the SMRR council members added 63 officers

to our police department.

Public Safety has always been a top priority for SMRR
council members. They don’t just talk about fighting
crime, they take action.

¢ SMRR knows that police visibility is the best
deterrent to crime and added 63 new police officers
to the department. Over the past 15 years, every
significant increase in police officers has been
initiated by SMRR supported council members.

e SMRR-supported council members initiated
community-based policing through bike, foot and
horse patrols and police substations on the

Promenade and the Pier. In the last year alone,
crime on the Pier has dropped by 50%.

e SMRR-supported council members have nurtured
strong community groups that bring neighbors
together to fight crime.

¢ SMRR-supported council members have supported
upgrading antiquated police communications
systems to reduce emergency response time.

e¢ SMRR-supported council members adopted
policies that have reduced aggressive panhandling,
camping and loitering in our parks.

Because of SMRR’'s leadership, crime is at the lowest
rate in 20 years.
