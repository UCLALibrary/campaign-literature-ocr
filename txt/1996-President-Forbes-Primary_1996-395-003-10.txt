Once again, the Republicans got bogged down in the
regulatory tar pit. Why don’t we just make it simple -- why don’t we
go all the way to Medical Savings Accounts that put the consumer
fully in charge, not the bureaucrats?

With Medical Savings Accounts, people would have cash to
cover routine medical expenses plus full catastrophic coverage above
a certain level. The gaping gaps of Medicare will disappear -- there
will be no more need for Medigap insurance. Americans will no
longer have the anxiety that they might fall between the Medicare
cracks.

And we would break the vicious cycle we’re caught in of
reducing benefits and raising costs to beneficiaries. Only if we take
control from the politicians and give it to the elderly themselves will
the elderly know that their medical coverage is safe and not subject.
to future back door deals. Isn’t it time to take health care in this area
out of the hands of Washington bureaucrats and put it into the hands
of the American people?

I think it’s time we started down the road less traveled-- with
tax cuts that are deep and wide. With sound money and a return of

interest rates to historic levels of 4 and 1/2 per cent.

And to finally break the grip of the Washington culture, we

must institute term limits. Still water stagnates. We need more
citizens like you participating in public life so that the public sector

serves we the people, not just itself.
Recently, I read the poll taken of small businessmen by the
NFIB. It asked them their reasons for taking that risk, starting that

new independent business. And you know what the top five were?
