And so as I say, the choice today is the same as it was
when Ronald Reagan spoke thirty years ago, up oF down --
up to the maximum of personal freedom within the
responsibilities of a free community, or down to an ever
larger and more intrusive state.

As it was thirty years ago, so today -- those who want
the state expanded always have their excuses, but our
movement has stood up to them in every form. And if we
are true to our mission, the great legacy we will leave at
the end of this century will be an America that is stronger
and freer and more faithful to its innermost spirit than ever
before.

That is what this campaign is about. That is why Iam
running for President. That is why I am asking for your
support. So that we as a nation continue that long epic
climb that Ronald Reagan spoke of for the first time before
this group -- up to our destiny, up to that shining City on
the Hill.

Thank you all very much and God bless you.
