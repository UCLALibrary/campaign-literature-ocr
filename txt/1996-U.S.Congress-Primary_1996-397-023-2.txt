Sherman won election to the 4th district seat on the Board of
Equalization. But even that wasn't enough for him. After
barely one year in office he registered to run for Congress in
our District. Can we really trust him to stand and fight
for our interests, or will he just cut and run... for the
next plum political job that comes along?

An attorney and successful businessman,

Jeff Lipow is running for Congress %&
to stand up to Newt Gingrich,

fight politics as usual and put
an end to gridlock in
Washington. Jeff is not a
professional politician. Jeff
Lipow is a problem solver
with a long history of
community volunteerism
and service to neighbors
less fortunate.

Running for office after office, it’s no wonder
one of Sherman’s first actions as a board
member was to put three of his campaign
workers on the state payroll.
