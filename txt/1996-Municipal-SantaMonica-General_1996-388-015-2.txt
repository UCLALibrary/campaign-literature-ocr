Community Service and
Statewide Leadership

“T believe that a quality education is the
foremost right of every individual. Asa
Santa Monica College Trustee for over fifteen
years, including six years as a member of
the Santa Monica-Malibu Board of Educa-
tion, I have strived to make Santa Monica
College accessible to all who seek a quality
education. As a state representative of the
community college system, I have worked,
and will continue to work, to improve the
quality of education not only for our com-
munity, but for the entire system as a whole.”’
