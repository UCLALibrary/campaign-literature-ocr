Peace Officers Research Association of California

Representing 42,000 front-line police officers and deputy sheriffs

Dear Citizens:

In the short time it takes to read this letter, a robbery or burglary will be
committed, a car will be stolen, and an individual will be assaulted some-
where in the Los Angeles-Burbank-Glendale area.

The 42,000 front-line crimefighters in our organization are made tragically
aware of this fact every day. That's why we're writing to you today.

Scott is a father of five who knows first-hand the fears parents face.
He supports swift enforcement of the death penalty. Three strikes.
And zero tolerance for weapons on school grounds.

In addition, Scott's protection-punishment-prevention plan for fighting crime
calls for more police on patrol, anti-gang efforts, and early intervention to
keep youthful offenders from repeating their crimes.

The Peace Officers Research Association of California, representing 42,000
front-line police officers and deputy sheriffs, strongly endorses Scott
Wildman for State Assembly.

In our judgment, he is the best candidate for the job of reducing crime and
making our neighborhoods safe.

Sincerely,

le

Steven H. Craig
President
