That’s reason enough to re-elect
Sheila Kuehl - and here are four more.

Toughening sentences for violent
offenders. Over the past two years,
Sheila has toughened prison sentences for
violent offenders like rapists, child
molesters, domestic abusers, and criminals
who use guns.

Cracking down on domestic
violence. Sheila uses her experience as
an national domestic violence expert to
create landmark laws to give serious
treatment to domestic violence and child
abuse. This year, she sponsored bills to
protect teenage victims of dating violence
and sexual assault at school.

Breaking the cycle of violence.
Sheila supports gang and drug prevention

Fighting for sensible gun laws.
Sheila is not afraid to stand up to the

powerful NRA. This year she helped kill a bill
that would have legalized certain assault
weapons. She works hand in hand with law
enforcement to get guns out of the hands of

programs that give kids alternatives to a life
of crime. She authored a law creating an
innovative after school youth program for
at-risk kids — the only one of its kind to be

criminals and to ban Saturday Night passed by the legislature last year.
