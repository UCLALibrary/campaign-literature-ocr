» According to the
Franchise Tax Board,
between 1980 and 1994,
the after-tax incomes of
the top 1% of taxpayers
increased 36% while
the after-tax incomes of
the bottom 80% went
down by almost 9%
after adjusting for
inflation.

Wilson and the
Legislature have
approved tax breaks to
big business that will
cost taxpayers $2.2
billion this year. But
they also increased
sales taxes by $4.1
billion annually, vehicle
license taxes by $822
million, and income
taxes on renters by
$520 million.

say keeping the top
brackets will hurt small

affected by Prop. 217.

California Ballot Pamphlet,

ROPOSITION 217, THE “TOP

Bracket” initiative, offers a
rare opportunity at fair taxation
for low and middle income
wage earners. It also helps our
overcrowded schools and fixes
some of the fiscal damage done
to our communities when
Governor Wilson robbed the
state’s cities and counties of $3
billion per year in property
taxes to balance the state budget.
Currently, the wealthiest 1
percent of Californians — those
whose average income is
$488,000 a year — are scheduled
to receive a massive $700
million tax cut. No other
taxpayers are getting any tax
relief.

Proposition 217:

In the meantime, the recession
of the early 1990’s — coupled
with Wilson’s property tax rip-
off — forced communities to
make deep cuts in local services.
Everything from library hours,
to school maintenance to
probation supervision for
criminals received the ax.

According to the Sacramento Bee,
this scheduled tax cut “would
continue to starve local
governments and give tax cuts
to the state’s richest citizens.
Proposition 217 is a necessary
antidote to a state leadership
that has abandoned California
principles of fairness and
community.”

(Editorial, Oct. 6, 1996)

What your vote will do
Your vote for Proposition 217 will prowede

$2,500 to every classroom in
California and $350 million to our
communities to replace some of
the money taken by

Governor Wilson. It

overturns an earlier decision

by the Legislature and

Governor to let the 10% and

11% brackets of the state

income tax expire. These rates
apply only to the wealthiest 1% of
the state's taxpayers. Prop. 217 also
puts a cap on how much property tax
the state can take from local
governments.

Final blow to communities

VER-CROWDED SCHOOLS,
OC. and fire protection
and other local services are still
reeling from the financial
impact of the recent recession
and Governor Wilson’s $3
billion property tax rip-off.
Proposition 218, the so-called
“Right to Vote on Taxes Act,”
will be the final blow to our
communities if it passes.

Proposition 218 violates the
principle of “one person, one
vote.” It weights voting strength

Proposition 218:

by the amount of land you own.

Therefore, wealthy landowners
and corporations would have
more voting power than
average homeowners. Renters
would have no vote at all.

Prop. 218 eliminates the
exemption from property
assessment for publicly owned
property. School districts and
local agencies will have to pay
taxes, thereby diverting scarce
furids from local services.

What your vote will do
A vote against Proposition 218 will protect

your right to vote on tax assessment

issues in your community. Proposition

218 restricts the right to vote on
tax assessments to those who
own land. It enacts “proportional
voting” — those who own more
land get more votes. It transfers
voting power away from
individual homeowners and
renters and gives it to
corporations, developers,
wealthy land owners, even
out-of-state interests

and foreign citizens.
Schools will have WZ
to take money —

away from
classrooms to pay property
taxes.

>» America has the most
unequal distribution of
property ownership in the
industrialized world. The

top 1% of Americans own

40% of all property. By
contrast, in Great Britain,
the top 1% own only 18%
of all property.

» According to the
Legislative Analyst, Prop.
218 eliminates over $100
million annually in
existing property tax
funding for fire
protection, lighting,
ambulance and library
services.

> Last year an Orange
County Superior Court
judge found that the
Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Assc.— the sponsor of
Prop. 218 — had
“hoodwinked” the public
with fraudulent
fundraising letters and
fined the association
$300,000 for failing to
report $730,000 in income.
