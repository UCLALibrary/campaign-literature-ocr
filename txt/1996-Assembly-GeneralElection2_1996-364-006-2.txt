Torrance, California

My parents are long-time Torrance homeowners. My older brother and his two
children reside with them.

Two years ago, without any warning from anyone, a group called the Masada
Home moved in next door.

To my parents’ amazement, the Masada Home turned out to be a state licensed
facility to house convicted teenage boys, the majority of whom, according to the
State Department of Social Services, meet the following criteria:

“'.a history of gang violence, sexual perpetrator disorder (rapist), substance
abuse disorder (alcohol/drugs), and antisocial behavior.”

Since the Masada Home moved in next door... life for my parents and their
neighbors has been a living hell.

They have been victims of an attempted burglary; my niece has been sexually
harassed and subjected to lewd gestures, and they are continually bombarded by
loud obscene yelling, and screaming.

Outraged that our state government would sponsor a program that would allow
a residential neighborhood to be so terrorized... we contacted our State Assemblywoman,
Debra Bowen, and asked for her heip in getting the Masada Home out.

She refused to help. She later announced that she knew of no problem with
this facility, and in fact strongly supported the Masada Home.

We also contacted our local councilman, Dan Walker.

Unlike Debra Bowen, Councilman Walker immediately responded to our
concerns. He met with my family and their neighbors, and voiced their fears before
the entire City Council.

Because the state controls this program, Dan Walker as our Councilman can’t
close it down... but as our Assemblyman, Dan Walker will fight to do so.

The Masada Home is still there... still causing problems. In fact, the police
were there again last week.

Under California law, a Masada Home could open up next door to you
tomorrow. That’s why my family, their neighbors and I ask you to join us in voting
for Dan Walker for Assembly. We need your help.

Sincerely,
