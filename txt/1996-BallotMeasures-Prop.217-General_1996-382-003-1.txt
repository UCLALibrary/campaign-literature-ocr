THE SCHOOL + COMMUNITY INVESTMENT INITIATIVE

ition of taxpayers, teachers, firefighters, seniors, law enforcement, tax reform organizations and labor.

HROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA, many communities—

counties, cities, school and community college

districts, park and library districts—are in deep

fiscal trouble. Budget crises have left our schools
the most overcrowded in the nation and have strained
police and fire protection, library, emergency medical
care, public health and child protection services.

One of the primary reasons for the fiscal strain in our
communities: lawmakers have shifted billions of dollars in
local property tax revenues to Sacramento since 1992 to
balance the state budget. Sacramento Bee columnist Dan
Walters called the property tax shift “larceny on a huge
scale.” In addition, spending on schools has slowed while
enrollment has skyrocketed.

Historically, property tax revenues, collected locally
by county auditors, have been allocated by counties to
local agencies in accordance with state law and the state
constitution. Counties in particular have been struggling
with the effect of formulas put in place after Prop. 13.

In 1992, Sacramento changed the formula and
shifted $1.4 billion of property tax revenues away from
local communities to the state budget. In 1993, the

state again shifted property taxes away from local
governments. The annual shift of local property taxes to
the state now amounts to more than $3.6 billion per
year.

There have been efforts to restore some revenues
lost by communities in the property tax shift. The most
significant effort was Prop. 172, which made a temporary
half-cent state sales tax permanent and dedicated
revenues‘to local governments. The amount of revenue
produced by the increased sales tax for communities
varies widely, depending upon cities’ and counties’ sales
tax collections. According to the state’s Legislative
Analyst, the average amount recovered from Prop. 172 to
replace shifted property tax revenues is about 41%.

In order to more fully and fairly fund local services
such as police protection, libraries and parks and provide
additional support to struggling schools, Prop. 217:

+ Raises $860 million in the first year and $700 million
in each following year without cutting or affecting any
other state or local programs. Revenues are raised
by keeping the top 10% and 11% state income tax
