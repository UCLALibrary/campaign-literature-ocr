“the politics of meaning,” as Tikkun Magazine would say.

Thirty years ago in the Port Huron Statement, we who
began the 60s student movement wrote not only of political
reform, but of the need to address “loneliness, estrangement
and isolation.” We wrote that love and compassion should
overcome the “idolatry of worshipping things.” We longed
to fulfill the “unfulfilled capacities for reason, freedom and
love.”

Now that the old frontiers are becoming exhausted, the
agenda of the inner frontier calls us to be present. The
question before California is that posed by Rodney King
during the violence of 1992, “can't we all just get along?”

Our destiny depends on how well we answer that question.
If we remain in the grip of old answers and old politics, we
will fail. If we embrace a new politics of the spirit, we.can
realize a new California dream. As Emerson wrote, “When
Nature has work to do, she creates a genius to do it.”
