Facts You Should Know.

* There are no limits on campaign contributions to state elected officials.

Who's Buying Your Government?
During 1993-1994, the top five PACs contributed $5.6 million to state elected officials:

The California Teachers Association $1,370,483
Container Supply Company/Rob Hurt (Hurtt) $1,215,559
Allied Business PAC, an ideological PAC, $1,085,388
California Medical Association $1,040,130
California Trial Lawyers Association $ 950,738

These PACs don't just give out of the goodness of their hearts, they give to get
something in return -- access to elected officials and influence over governmental
decisions.

Why Should You Care?

The financing of campaigns has a direct effect on the decisions that California's
elected officials make on critical issues that affect your daily life -- the cost of car
insurance, access to affordable health care, the quality of education, restrictions on
toxic waste disposal, resources for police, fire and emergency services. A few
examples:

* The Dentists' PAC which contributed over $500,000 in '93 -'94 defeated legislation
that would allow dental hygienists to setup independent practices. This bill would have
significantly increased access to basic dental services.

* Oil companies which contributed over $1 million in '93-'94 won passage of a bill that
weakens clean-up standards for property contaminated by hazardous waste.

+ Insurance agents successfully lobbied to put hundreds of millions of dollars in

commissions off-limits in the calculation of the rebates mandated under Prop. 103.
According to the Dept. of Insurance this cost CA consumers $300 million.
