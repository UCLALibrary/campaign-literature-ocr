AS RESIDENTS OF SANTA MONICA IT 1S NATURAL TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE
OF OUR COMMUNITY, THE DIRECTION THAT CITY GOVERNMENT iS TAKING US. AS WE
READ THE DAILY PAPERS WE CAN'T HELP BEING DISGUSTED. WE WONDER WHY WE PAY
FOR PARKING PASSES THAT SELDOM ALLOW US TO PARK CLOSE TO OUR HOUSES. OUR
SENIOR CITIZENS WANT FREE PARKING AND THEY TRULY DESERVE IT. AS WE TAKE OUR
FAMILIES TO OUR CITY PARKS WE WONDER WHY SOMETHING CAN'T BE DONE ABOUT THE
VAGRANCY IN OUR CITY. WE HEAR OUR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS STRESS THE IMPORTANCE
OF HOLDING THEIR MAJORITY ON THE COUNCIL. THE SPECIAL INTEREST OBVIOUSLY HAS
ALL THERE INTEREST. HAS OUR CITY COUNCIL BEEN SO WRAPPED UP IN SPECIAL
INTEREST THAT THEY FORGOT ABOUT OUR INTERESTS OR HAVE THEY BEEN A.W.OLL.
AWAY WITHOUT LEADERSHIP. IT'S TIME TO TAKE SPECIAL INTEREST THAT IS DEVOTED
TO YOU AND OUR COMMUNITY. WE NEED A CITY GOVERNMENT COUNCIL THAT 1S LOYAL
AND FAIR AND NOT CONTROLLED BY SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS.
