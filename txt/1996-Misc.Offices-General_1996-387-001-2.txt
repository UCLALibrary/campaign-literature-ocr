NO ONE HAS EVER QUESTIONED NIDA ALEX’S HONESTY

Nida Alex has served as a Judge Pro-tem on both the Citrus and
Pomona Courts. Her opponent has no judicial experience.

Nida Alex will increase access to the court. She will protect victim’s
rights and be certain about the protection of witnesses. Her opponent

has tragically failed to protect witnesses.

Nida Alex will give tough sentences to convicted repeat offenders and
will look very carefully at any plea bargain. Her opponent, an assistant
D.A. plea bargains, even reducing murder charges to manslaughter.
Nida Alex’s qualifications are impressive. She is a graduate of California
State University School of Engineering, and Southwestern School of Law,
and has taught as an adjunct professor at Glendale Law School.

Nida Alex does not intend to use the Citrus Courts as a stepping stone
to higher office.
