That’s why he’ll fight to improve public schools and to protect
college loans. It’s also why he mentors kids like Chris Perkins.

Doug Kahn will fight
for our kids.

In Congress, he’ll push for tough aca-
demic standards, computers in the
classroom, expanded teacher train-
ing, safe schools, and the school
lunch program.

Doug Kahn understands
that education and job

training are the keys to
improving the economy.

But Doug doesn’t just talk about
education; he acts to improve the
education of local kids like Chris

Paitins. He’ll strongly oppose Republican

efforts to cut college loans and grants,
and he’ll work hard to expand job
training programs so our workers can
compete in the global economy.

As a volunteer mentor at Pasadena
High School’s Graphic Arts Academy,
Doug helps Chris learn job skills he can
use when he graduates.
