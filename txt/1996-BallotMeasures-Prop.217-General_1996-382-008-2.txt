This means that even if the proponents’ tenuous interpretation is correct, the initiative
would deny redevelopment agencies any growth in their share of property taxes.

If a new redevelopment project's tax increment revenue were to increase that
redevelopment agency's proportionate share of countywide property taxes, it would
result in a corresponding decrease in the proportionate share of property tax allocated
to all other local agencies in the county. Because the initiative would prohibit that
corresponding decrease in other agencies’ share of property taxes, it would appear that
no new redevelopment projects could be undertaken.

In a briefing session with Legislative Analyst's staff, proponents and opponents of
Proposition 217 debated this very point. The author of Proposition 217 admitted that it
probably would prevent expansion of redevelopment and expressed no regrets about
that conclusion, although he said it was unintended.

Redevelopment agencies are one of California's most potent tools for economic
development. Here are a few examples of recent community revitalization projects
made possible by redevelopment agency funds: Third Street Promenade in Santa
Monica, Old Town Pasadena, Old Sacramento, and Horton Plaza in San Diego.

Redevelopment agency revenues also are utilized to preserve jobs. For example, the
City of Emeryville'recently used redevelopment agency funds to help expand a
biotechnology facility, keeping the company from accepting out-of-state pfs to
relocate, saving 1,000 California jobs.
