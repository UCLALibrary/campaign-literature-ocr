America is being “Balkanized” today.

That’s one of the major reasons I’ve stepped forward to run
for President. But to keep our campaign for immigration reform
on the agenda, I need your help in two ways.

(1) Will you please fill out your Republican Referendum on
Illegal Immigration and return it to me today? Your
Referendum will help me let Republican officials and
the other presidential candidates know that the
American people want action to stop illegal
immigration.

(2) Please send Buchanan for President your largest
possible donation to help me carry our platform for
immigration reform into the presidential primaries.

Your check for $25, $50, $100, $250, $500 or even $1,000 will
help me pay for issues research, brochures, posters, bumper
stickers and TV ads in early primary/caucus states like Iowa and
New Hampshire.

I need your help so that the truth about the illegal
immigration crisis can be aired, discussed and effectively
addressed by the presidential candidates.

Working together, you and I can take back America for the
values that were instilled in us as children. We want to leave
for future generations an America that resonates with the
traditions upon which our nation was founded, and for which men
and women have fought and died for more than 200 years.

Today, the illegal alien crisis is fueling the cultural
breakdown which you and I have recognized and sworn to fight.

Please help me with your most generous gift of support --
$25, $50, even $100 -- or whatever you can afford to make this
campaign a success. There is no time to waste.

Your Friend,

atrick J. Buchanan

P.S. With your help, the GOP candidates for President will not
get away with ignoring the nation’s illegal alien crisis. With
your help, I can make sure this crucial issue gets the kind of
extensive debate it deserves. Please let me hear from you today.
