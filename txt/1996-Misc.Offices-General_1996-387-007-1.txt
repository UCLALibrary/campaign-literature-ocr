Scott Schreiber
"The Sensible Alternative to Tom Hayden"

"As lifelong Democrats, we normally never
support Republicans. But in the case of the 23rd State
Senate District race, Tom Hayden is completely out of
touch with even mainstream Democrats. We can no
longer remain silent in the face of Tom Hayden's
repeated efforts to hijack the Democrat Party for his
own radical agenda. Scott Schreiber is by far the
sensible alternative to Tom Hayden."

-- Stan Sapiro

+ Treasurer of L.A. Truman for President
Committee-1948.

+ Past-President of several San Fernando
Valley Democrat clubs.
