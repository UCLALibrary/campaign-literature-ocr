I am a Republican because...

I believe that the proper function of government is to do for the
people those things that have to be done but cannot be done, or
cannot be done as well, by individuals, and that the most effective
government is government closest to the people.

I believe that good government is based on the individual and
that each personâ€™s ability, dignity, freedom, and responsibility
must be honored and recognized.

I believe that free enterprise and the encouragement of individual
initiative and incentive have given this nation an economic
system second to none.

I believe that sound money management should be our goal.

I believe in equal rights, equal justice, and equal opportunity for
all, regardless of race, creed, age, sex, or national origin.

I believe we must retain those principles of the past worth
retaining, yet always be receptive to new ideas with an outlook
broad enough to accommodate thoughtful change and varying
points of view.

I believe that Americans value and should preserve their feeling
of national strength and pride, and at the same time share with
people everywhere a desire for peace and freedom and the
extension of human rights throughout the world!

Finally, I believe that the Republican Party is the best vehicle for
translating these ideals into positive and successful principles of
government.
