CONCERNS OF WORKING FAMILIES

Economic Recovery

@ Under President Clinton, the unemployment rate has
fallen to only 5.4 %. Home ownership among Americans
is at its highest level in 15 years. The economy has
created more than 9 million new jobs in under four years,
and the budget deficit is nearly half of what it was when
Clinton’s term began. Also, 1.2 million fewer Americans
are living in poverty since the President took office in
1993.

The Minimum Wage
§ Earlier this year, President Clinton led the fight for
raising the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour.
In support of his position, the President pointed to studies
showing that 4 out of every 10 people who earn the
minimum wage are the sole breadwinner in their homes.
President Clinton called on Senator Dole to join him in
urging Congress to pass the 90-cent increase in the
minimum wage. Dole finally did so on May 24 — the
day after the House of Representatives approved it.

Safe Neighborhoods

= Congress approved President Clinton’s Crime Bill,
which will eventually fund 100,000 new police officers.
The bill also included a ban.on 17 types of assault
weapons. Some have called for repealing the ban on
assault weapons, but Clinton has pledged to “veto any
attempt to repeal the assault weapons ban.”

Retirement Savings
@ President Clinton has opposed attempts by Congress to
allow corporations to dip into the pension funds set aside
for their employees’ retirement. Under the Clinton
administration, the Department of Labor 401-k enforce-
ment program has helped to lower the underfunding of
pensions — ensuring that employees’ savings are
actually contributed to their retirement plans and invested.

12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn , adopted
child or a family member who is ill.

cut by 25% the funds used by the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency to help local communities enforce the Clean

Water Act and Clean Air Act.
(Presidential veto of H.R. 2099 on 12/18/95)
