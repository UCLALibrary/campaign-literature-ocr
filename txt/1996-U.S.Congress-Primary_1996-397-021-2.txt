expertise to challenge Newt Gingrich’s
Congress and fight to protect middle

Barry Gordon can win in
November.

candidate for Congress who can win in
November and help put an end to
Newt Gingrich’s reign of extremism.
His Democratic opponent, Doug Kahn,
has already lost two elections for this

just can’t afford not to nominate our
best Democratic candidate.

We must vote for our best candidate on Mareh 26.
